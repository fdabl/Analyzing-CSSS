Discrimination of economic Input-Output networks using Persistent Homology,"Viewing Input-Output (IO) tables as weighted complex networks, we investigate how certain characteristics of an economy are associated with the internal structural “shape” defined by its IO flows, as considered separately from its absolute magnitude. In this initial exploration, we examine domestic Input-Output table data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for 62 national economies from 7 different years spanning 1995 to 2011.",,Social and behavioural science,4,Jae Beum Cho,Urban Planning,Architecture and building,"Hi, I am Jae B. Cho, a 3rd year PhD candidate at Cornell University in the department of City and Regional Planning. My primary interest is in complexity and social networks, especially how social networks dictate the formation of social capital at the individual level, and how community development can affect individual socioeconomic outcomes. I am also interested in the impact of social networks and social capital on individual entrepreneurs; whether they can get useful information and other benefits from the network ties they maintain in bettering their entrepreneurial outcomes. Finally, I consider myself a regional economist, and am interested in social interactions models within a regional (urban or county level) context. In my spare time I like to play tennis (although admittedly a novice) and am looking forward to possibly playing with fellow CSSS attendees, so let me know if you're interested!",,Male,Student,Cornell University,United States,2015,Santa Fe,Jackie,

Mapping Complexity/Human Knowledge as a Complex Adaptive System,,,Computing,2,Anna Zaytseva,Information Systems,Computing,"I am doing my PhD in Information Systems at the University of Oslo in Norway (3rd year), and soon I am going to get my degree. I apply the approach of Complex Adaptive Systems to generate a stepwise method to study mutual shaping between technologies and law, so the space in between those two – at the edge – is in focus. That space is a CAS with memory. I have two case studies of radically different e-health technologies of Norway, and each case has an own CAS. A CAS initially consists of about a hundred to almost a thousand smallest elements depending on the scale of a case. The elements are legal as norms & values, technologic as technical & conceptual, and social in situ & ex situ for the design work. Having appeared once, the elements of each CAS re-appear in time and increase in quantity to several thousand, what makes the memories be path-dependent and highly interconnected inside. Although the research is completely qualitative, manual and bottom-up, it provides a non-linear analysis of the phenomenon of mutual shaping between technologies and law with large visual representations at each subsequent step conducted in accordance with rules, which I have generated from one case study and replicated in another. In my method, I trace causalities in the CAS(s) and test a hypothesis whether attractors in the legal environment are shared among the design works on those technologies. Three attractors from four vs. six are shared, whereas the remaining ones invite a third case study. Unique technical implications in specific shapes and their information loops with the legal environment are indicated and the reasons explained. The research provides a transdisciplinary path for studying the complexity between law and technologies and calls specialists in the local fields – law, design studies and organization science – to examine the findings in detail by use of their own discipline methodologies.

My own initial background is in law, which I got at the National Research University – Higher School of Economics in Russia, and I wrote my Master’s thesis on policy analysis of standardization in six innovation markets of the European Union, what I did at Linköping University in Sweden. Besides, I have work experience both in public and private organizations. I am very interested in technologies and their architectures, as well as approaches to anticipate future. I have my own home library in Complexity Science that I consider to be advanced transdisciplinary methodology in harmony with nature. Therefore, at CSSS 2015 I am particularly interested to learn more about emerging transdisciplinary approaches for data analysis, where meanings behind words play crucial role. I am also concerned about visualization issues, co-evolution phenomena, bottom-up analytic strategies for complex systems research, information theory aspects, and simplicity behind the variety of self-organization forms.

Complex Systems Techniques applied to Power Transmission Expansion Planning,"Choosing how new lines should be installed in a power grid, or Transmission Expansion Planning (TEP) is a problem of considerable complexity. Any power grid has a large number (hundreds to tens of thousands) of components, meaning that any upgrades must take into account the current infrastructure. Additionally, there are many possible additional lines that one could add to an existing power grid. Furthermore, any design must be weighted by investment and operation cost. This requires analyzing the optimal use of generation and transmission assets using optimal power flow models that simulate the physical laws governing power flows (Kirchhoff’s Laws) as well as infrastructure limits. Given the importance of this problem, many approaches have been tested. However, we found that there were still some tools, related to the Complex Systems environment, which have not yet been applied in this field. We therefore undertake the project of exploring the possibilities of some of these tools. The research we have completed while at CSSS has allowed us to write three working papers, each detailing a different application of Complex Systems tools to TEP:

Part I: Generating Random Networks that are Consistent with Power Transmission
Part II: An Agent-Based Model for Transmission Expansion Planning

Complex Systems Techniques applied to Power Transmission Expansion Planning,"Choosing how new lines should be installed in a power grid, or Transmission Expansion Planning (TEP) is a problem of considerable complexity. Any power grid has a large number (hundreds to tens of thousands) of components, meaning that any upgrades must take into account the current infrastructure. Additionally, there are many possible additional lines that one could add to an existing power grid. Furthermore, any design must be weighted by investment and operation cost. This requires analyzing the optimal use of generation and transmission assets using optimal power flow models that simulate the physical laws governing power flows (Kirchhoff’s Laws) as well as infrastructure limits. Given the importance of this problem, many approaches have been tested.

Human Path Finding in a Semantic Word Game,"Human decision-making processes are inevitably influenced by mental images, which are triggered by cues such as objects,
concepts, and words. The cognitive associations between words can be captured and represented as a semantic network,
in which words represent nodes and association between words are edges. How efficiently can humans traverse this word
association network to a given target word if, at each moment, they can only make choices about the next word they will visit?
Using participant traversal data from the appropriately designed semantic game MindPaths, we show that human players
do not rely on guessing, but navigate this association network quite efficiently, finding a specified target word often in the
minimal number of steps. We construct models to capture human paths within the MindPaths game. We find that similarity in
overall game length is easy to achieve with a trained random walker. We then consider a model of individual choices using
Bayesian estimation of transition probabilities conditional on local network connectivity. We find that it is difficult to capture the
individual decisions or the decision making process of human players. More complex models driven by semantic similarities
and other types of relations between words are necessary to fully understand how individuals choose a particular path within
this semantic word game.",,Social and behavioural science,3,Nicole Beckage,"Computer Science, Cognitive Science",Computing,Nicole Beckage is a PhD student in Computer Science and Cognitive Science at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Swidden agriculture,"Swidden farming in the Toledo district of Belize is a relatively young subsistence agricultural technique in which each farmer enlists help from his friends to clean a patch of land, grow crops, and harvest. The resulting near-reciprocal social network of exchange of agricultural labor constitutes an essential component of the coupled human natural system that operates in this region. This paper describes a preliminary effort to develop an agent-based model of this system, which started as a demonstration model in NetLogo and evolved into 3 candidate models that were evaluated for basic viability criteria to exhibit fundamental features of the Toledo district, such as its characteristic cultivation cycle in which a patch is usually farmed for 2 years at most, then left to fallow for 7 years at least. In our evaluation, we were able to conclude that the 3 proposed models cannot meet the proposed criteria, thus leaving us with the alternative of introducing the cycle as an explicit constraint. We plan to use what we have learned and the tools we have built in the development of future models that produce viable scenarios in order to move on to the study of social properties and emergent phenomena of such models.",,Agriculture and forestry and fishery,3,Lindsay Todman,Engineering,Engineering and engineering trades,"I originally trained as a mechanical engineer but subsequently studied hydrology and then, for my PhD, focused on modelling water flow through soil from a novel irrigation system, which also desalinated the water.

Since then, having discovered biological physics, I have seen how the methods and reasoning that appealed to me in physics can be applied to the biological systems that fascinated me in school. This led me to my current PhD project, modelling tissue self-organisation in the early mammalian embryo. After my PhD, I hope to continue researching complex biological systems in whatever form this may take, and hope that the Complex Systems Summer School will help me on this path, as I learn new techniques and draw greater perspective from new fields, topics and people.

Outside of my research, I am a serious rower, competing mostly in the single scull with significant results on a national and international level. I also love building, fixing and riding bikes, am passionate about good coffee (I really hope there are some good espresso bars in Santa Fe), and have a long-held love of birdwatching.",,Male,Student,University of Cambridge,United Kingdom,2016,Santa Fe,Jackie,

Simple Agent-Based Model of the Development of Trust in Hierarchical Organizations,"Hierarchical organizations typically rely on a chain of command in which supervisors instruct subordinates to perform certain actions in order to advance the interests and objectives of the organization.

Human Path Finding in a Semantic Word Game,"Human decision-making processes are inevitably influenced by mental images, which are triggered by cues such as objects,
concepts, and words. The cognitive associations between words can be captured and represented as a semantic network,
in which words represent nodes and association between words are edges. How efficiently can humans traverse this word
association network to a given target word if, at each moment, they can only make choices about the next word they will visit?
Using participant traversal data from the appropriately designed semantic game MindPaths, we show that human players
do not rely on guessing, but navigate this association network quite efficiently, finding a specified target word often in the
minimal number of steps. We construct models to capture human paths within the MindPaths game. We find that similarity in
overall game length is easy to achieve with a trained random walker. We then consider a model of individual choices using
Bayesian estimation of transition probabilities conditional on local network connectivity. We find that it is difficult to capture the
individual decisions or the decision making process of human players. More complex models driven by semantic similarities
and other types of relations between words are necessary to fully understand how individuals choose a particular path within
this semantic word game.",,Social and behavioural science,3,Frank Marrs,Statistics,Mathematics and statistics,"I am a first-year Statistics PhD student at Colorado State University.

Opportunistic attachment assembles plant–pollinator networks,"Species and interactions are being lost at alarming rates and it is imperative to understand how communities assemble if we have to prevent their collapse and restore lost interactions. Using an
8-year dataset comprising nearly 20 000 pollinator visitation records, we explore the assembly of plant–pollinator communities at native plant restoration sites in an agricultural landscape. We
find that species occupy highly dynamic network positions through time, causing the assembly process to be punctuated by major network reorganisations. The most persistent pollinator species
are also the most variable in their network positions, contrary to what preferential attachment – the most widely studied theory of ecological network assembly – predicts. Instead, we suggest
assembly occurs via an opportunistic attachment process. Our results contribute to our understanding of how communities assembly and how species interactions change through time while
helping to inform efforts to reassemble robust communities.",,Life sciences,3,Asher Mullokandov,Physics,Physical sciences,"I am a PhD candidate in the Physics department at Boston University.

This paper describes a preliminary effort to develop an agent-based model of this system, which started as a demonstration model in NetLogo and evolved into 3 candidate models that were evaluated for basic viability criteria to exhibit fundamental features of the Toledo district, such as its characteristic cultivation cycle in which a patch is usually farmed for 2 years at most, then left to fallow for 7 years at least. In our evaluation, we were able to conclude that the 3 proposed models cannot meet the proposed criteria, thus leaving us with the alternative of introducing the cycle as an explicit constraint. We plan to use what we have learned and the tools we have built in the development of future models that produce viable scenarios in order to move on to the study of social properties and emergent phenomena of such models.",,Agriculture and forestry and fishery,3,Fabio Correa,"Physics, Anthropology",Physical sciences; Social and behavioural science,"In 2015 Fabio joined the University of Maryland's doctoral program in Anthropology.

Urban Scaling and Economic Analysis of Materials Stocked in Japanese Cities,"This research aims to explore the complexity inherent in the physical mass of cities—specifically in the materials that are stored within buildings and infrastructure. There is an important link between stocked materials and urban sustainability, particularly related to better understanding the resource requirements for the maintenance and growth of cities. This research explores materials stocked in Japanese cities, using a database with detailed GIS data of materials stored in buildings and roads at a resolution of one square kilometer. The analysis focuses on a single year, 2009 for buildings and 2010 for roads, and it includes two primary investigations: 1) urban scaling analyses to explore relationships between mass stocked, urban population, and other variables; and 2) non-parametric kernel estimations to better understand influential factors contributing to per-capita mass values.

I have been doing clinical work in institutions and private practice since 2007, and have also worked on the field of prevention, doing harm reduction talks and workshops, as well as statistics. I have spoken publicly (radio and television, public gatherings and seminars) and have presented scientific communications on my research around the world (so far in France, Australia and Mexico).

Research interests
My research interests aim at integrating dynamical and complex systems’ views in psychology (epistemology-wise as well as in clinical practice). I particularly focus on fractals and their relation to psychoanalysis and psychic phenomena in clinical settings, but also taking into account neuroscience, sociology, linguistics and behavior. Outside of traditional human sciences, I have focused on fractals, attractors, self-similarity, nodes, dissipative systems, phase transitions and feedback loops. This multidisciplinary approach sheds light on clinical treatment, repetition, symptoms, projection, bodily manifestations and psychopathological structures such as autism, psychosis, neurosis and their relation to the culture they are engrained in.

Current Research
I am currently doing my PH.D. at the Center for Research in Psychoanalysis, Medicine and Society at the University of Paris 7, Sorbonne-Cité, Denis-Diderot. My focus is on Fractals and the Psyche; repetition, structure and self-similarity. This research contributes to clinical, as well as epistemological aspects in the field of psychology. Fractals seem to be a key to understanding repetitive symptoms and maladaptive response systems, crucial factors for the efficiency of therapy.

While the regional boundaries are artificially created, dwellers move around them by walking, cycling or taking vehicles with various purposes and such movements in the cities generate “organic” boundaries. In this paper, we introduce how to extract such organic boundaries of cities based on the human mobility data and apply the method to analyze Singapore. We first create Voronoi cells, i.e. unit regions, of the city by using the public transportation and population datasets. Then we spatially interpolate the cells and create the mobility network of the interpolated cells by using the mobility dataset.

We then try to predict the stock prices out-of-sample, by employing other ABMs, a dynamical system and statistical models. Our goal is to check whether prediction is at all possible, and whether more complex models (such as the other ABMs) outperform simpler or statistical models. We show that in this case, a single realization of the ABM cannot be reliably predicted at all with any of the tested methods. A substantial level of noise casts a strong limit on the predictive power of the models. Considering the average realization of the out-of-sample stock prices, complex ABMs outperform simpler ABMs, dynamical systems and statistical methods. However, this result is not statistically significant due to the noise level. We conclude that for future research, it is necessary to design an ABM in which realistic assumptions increase the signal to noise ratio.",,Social and behavioural science; Computing,8,Yuji Saikai,Agricultural Economics,Agriculture and forestry and fishery; Social and behavioural science,"an introverted nerdy foodie, studying ag and food systems at UW-Madison | optimization | machine learning | agent-based modeling |",,Male,Student,University of Wisconsin,United States,2017,Santa Fe,Jackie,

Modeling and simulating the emergence of Internet communities: impact of the spread of memes and agent memory,"The spreading of memes on the web played an important role in the emergence of Internet communities. The principal purpose of the study is to implement a simulation model to analyze the process of emergence of Internet communities. The model shows the importance of factors such as the interactions between online agents as well as their propensity to adopt and remember new memes. In addition, it explores the threshold between isolated cultural short-lived trends and the viral spreading of many cultural features. The simulation model is an agent-based model built using NetLogoTM software, designed such that agents represent Internet users and memes are represented by features appearing randomly on each agent. The model illustrates the spread across the whole network as shown through interactions of agents indicating further, that the structure of the network, especially the number of indegree and outdegree links between agents, has a crucial influence on how many memes are shared among agents in the long run. In other words, a greater connectivity leads to the quick sharing and sustainability of several cultural features, which is the basis for the emergence of a community.",,"Social and behavioural science, Computing",4,Stephen Leese,Business,Business and administration,"International executive with experience in Strategy and Business Development, Start-up operations, Innovation development and Business Analytics.

Forecasting seasonal influenza in the United States using nonlinear time series analysis,"Forecasting of seasonal infectious diseases, such as influenza, can help in public health planning and outbreak response. We compared a traditional influenza forecasting method (an autoregressive moving average [ARMA] model) with a nearest neighbor forecasting approach (the Lorenz Method of Analogues), where nearest neighbors were identified from a reconstructed state space using delay coordinate embedding. Delay reconstruction and ARMA models used influenza-like-illness (ILI) surveillance data from 1997-2017 in the United States. We compared model forecasts of the 2015-2017 influenza seasons across 1-4 week prediction horizons. Each model's fit to ILI data (black line) is summarized in the figure below across the four prediction horizons.

Organic urban boundaries and clusters - analyzing Singapore as an example,"Cities are dynamic complex systems evolving through their functions and human activities. While the regional boundaries are artificially created, dwellers move around them by walking, cycling or taking vehicles with various purposes and such movements in the cities generate “organic” boundaries. In this paper, we introduce how to extract such organic boundaries of cities based on the human mobility data and apply the method to analyze Singapore. We first create Voronoi cells, i.e. unit regions, of the city by using the public transportation and population datasets. Then we spatially interpolate the cells and create the mobility network of the interpolated cells by using the mobility dataset. Applying community detection unveils the organic regions in Singapore and we see that in those self-organizing regions the number of population and facilities have scaling relationships.

"It from Bit: cellular automata, driven ising model, and emergent computation","We explored emergent computation within two systems — cellular automata (CA) and a driven Ising model. We attempted to generate emergent computation with a CA using a genetic algorithm, with the aim of understanding general conditions on information processing dynamics which increase computational capacity. Specifically, we aim to search the space of CAs to identify minimal computational units, which may in turn be used to execute specific computational tasks or optimize further search for collective computational behavior. In order to select for CAs with more computational capacity, we use an objective function defined in terms of dual total correlation (DTC), an information-theoretic quantity capturing the information in higher-order correlations between cells in a given spatial (and temporal) region of the time-dependent CA grid. The genetic algorithm evolves a population of CA update rules by testing average performance over a range of initial conditions, creating a new population favoring more successful rules, and iterating over a number of generations.",,Computing,5,Kyle Reing,Computer Science,Computing,"I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at USC with roughly 2 years under my belt.

Behavioral footprints of depression from mobile-phone usage patterns,"Depression is increasingly prevalent in society. Alone, it a↵ects over 16.1 million American adults and is today the single most pervasive mental illness in the world. Many efforts trying to address this problem leverage technological advancements such as smartphones and smart tracking devices, to facilitate patient self-reporting for use in analyses that can aid medical experts. However, patients frequently ”drop out” or do not self-report, likely a behavior caused by their perpetual depression. This begs the invention of reporting mechanisms that do not rely on active participation from the patient. In this paper, we investigate the relationships between behavioral indicators, measured from smartphone activity, and depression in a large population of highly interconnected young adults. We find that depression correlates strongly with features that indicate social activity, communicational responsiveness and academic attendance. Using this insight we construct a simple classification model that predicts, from their set of behavioral indicators, whether an individual is more or less depressed than the population median.

Agent-Based Prediction Competition,"We independently propose an Agent-Based Prediction Competition. We generate synthetic data from a financial market ABM. We then try to predict the stock prices out-of-sample, by employing other ABMs, a dynamical system and statistical models. Our goal is to check whether prediction is at all possible, and whether more complex models (such as the other ABMs) outperform simpler or statistical models. We show that in this case, a single realization of the ABM cannot be reliably predicted at all with any of the tested methods. A substantial level of noise casts a strong limit on the predictive power of the models. Considering the average realization of the out-of-sample stock prices, complex ABMs outperform simpler ABMs, dynamical systems and statistical methods. However, this result is not statistically significant due to the noise level. We conclude that for future research, it is necessary to design an ABM in which realistic assumptions increase the signal to noise ratio.",,Social and behavioural science; Computing,8,Uzay Çetin,Computer Science,Computing,,,Male,Student,Boğaziçi University,Turkey,2017,Santa Fe,Jackie,

Hops across cultural boundaries: a regional analysis of beer recipe ingredients and their pairing principles,"Brewing beer has come to be regarded as a form of art, yet the consumption of beer is a cultural-specific phenomenon that evolves regionally. In the United States, for example, commercially available beers have drastically increased in number and style over the course of the last 30 years. Here we quantify diversity in beer brewing within and across different regions of the globe using a data-driven approach. The Jaccard index is used to measure actual and functional diversity of regional beer recipe ingredients and the flavor compounds they contain. We identified highly prevalent ingredients, and found them to reflect many common vintage beer recipe ingredients. We also identified regionally authentic ingredients, and found that the cultural traditions of the region are represented within those ingredients. Overall, hops offered the most regional authenticity to the recipes. Aroma preferences for hops from Europe and North America are outlined, along with regional tendencies to share flavor molecules in beer recipe ingredients.",,Social and behavioural science,3,Zhiya Zuo,Information Science,Computing,"I am a 3rd-Year PhD student in Information Science at the University of Iowa, under the supervision of Prof. Kang Zhao.

Trade patterns in international fishery markets,"Global trade is a driver of the state of present ecosystems, but the mechanisms through which trade affects ecosystems remains poorly understood. Seafood is one of the most globally integrated food commodities with 40% traded internationally. The increasing globalization of trade in marine products has been pointed to as a potential reason for the overexploitation of wild stocks. Traders can establish new trade relations with other countries which means there is less incentive for the conservation of local resources. We analyzed patterns in trade relations and stock status in exporting countries using global trade and stock assessment databases. We analyzed the evolution of the trade networks of several stocks over time and found increased connectivity and an expanding trade network, though the overall volume of traded stocks stayed relatively stable. Whole networks changed significantly over the years and shared very little similarity (~20%) between years. The 100 and 25 most connected nodes within these networks, however, stayed more stable over time (~50-60 percent similar). In the future we will explore the changing networks by using tools for anomaly detection as well as descriptive network statistics to investigate the patterns that enable the sequential/serial exploitation of marine stocks. We hope that these efforts will culminate in a network model or exponential random graph that describes the underlying mechanisms that cause sequential overexploitation of marine populations.",,Business and administration; Agriculture and forestry and fishery,7,Elaine Bochniewicz,Engineering,Engineering and engineering trades,"I have a background in Computer Science and Math.

Modeling and simulating the emergence of Internet communities: impact of the spread of memes and agent memory,"The spreading of memes on the web played an important role in the emergence of Internet communities. The principal purpose of the study is to implement a simulation model to analyze the process of emergence of Internet communities. The model shows the importance of factors such as the interactions between online agents as well as their propensity to adopt and remember new memes. In addition, it explores the threshold between isolated cultural short-lived trends and the viral spreading of many cultural features. The simulation model is an agent-based model built using NetLogoTM software, designed such that agents represent Internet users and memes are represented by features appearing randomly on each agent. The model illustrates the spread across the whole network as shown through interactions of agents indicating further, that the structure of the network, especially the number of indegree and outdegree links between agents, has a crucial influence on how many memes are shared among agents in the long run. In other words, a greater connectivity leads to the quick sharing and sustainability of several cultural features, which is the basis for the emergence of a community.",,"Social and behavioural science, Computing",4,Aida Huerta Barrientos,Operations,Engineering and engineering trades,"Dr. Aida Huerta Barrientos is an academic-researcher the Department of Operations Research, Faculty of Engineering, UNAM, focusing on modeling and simulation of complex adaptive systems to analyze their emergent patterns, explain and predict their viable dynamics, and determine their fitness landscape.

"Quantifying and comparing “memory” in biological, ecological, physical, and socio-economic systems","Most real-world systems demonstrate in their behavior some degree of dependence on past behavior and conditions, or some capacity to store information about the past in their dynamics. This ”memory” of a system, be it cognitive or ecological, cultural or physical, has vital implications for those who wish to infer and predict the states and behavior of that system. Each discipline defines memory in its own way, as legacy effects, information transmitted from past to future, information stored in a process, cross-generational response to stimulus, etc. We use an information theoretic framework to unite these definitions and attempt to draw useful comparisons between systems spanning the biological, physical, and social spheres. To do this, we worked with epsilon machines (εM), a type of hidden Markov model in which the states represent causal pasts. We used a technique known as causal state splitting reconstruction (CSSR) to infer these machines from both synthetic data and real-world observations. To develop an inferential basis for statistical complexity using the εM approach, we performed benchmarking experiments, and showed that statistical complexity is positively correlated with memory strength and the pattern is consistent across most realistic perturbation levels and alphabet sizes. We then applied this approach to time series data of precipitation, soil moisture, game theory, animal movement, net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE), and coral reef metabolism. Within and across these systems, the relationship between estimated entropy rate (randomness/unpredictability of the time series) and statistical complexity follows the expected bell-shape, with the highest statistical complexity occurring at intermediate unpredictability (Figure 1).

Organic urban boundaries and clusters - analyzing Singapore as an example,"Cities are dynamic complex systems evolving through their functions and human activities. While the regional boundaries are artificially created, dwellers move around them by walking, cycling or taking vehicles with various purposes and such movements in the cities generate “organic” boundaries. In this paper, we introduce how to extract such organic boundaries of cities based on the human mobility data and apply the method to analyze Singapore. We first create Voronoi cells, i.e. unit regions, of the city by using the public transportation and population datasets. Then we spatially interpolate the cells and create the mobility network of the interpolated cells by using the mobility dataset. Applying community detection unveils the organic regions in Singapore and we see that in those self-organizing regions the number of population and facilities have scaling relationships.

Hops across cultural boundaries: a regional analysis of beer recipe ingredients and their pairing principles,"Brewing beer has come to be regarded as a form of art, yet the consumption of beer is a cultural-specific phenomenon that evolves regionally. In the United States, for example, commercially available beers have drastically increased in number and style over the course of the last 30 years. Here we quantify diversity in beer brewing within and across different regions of the globe using a data-driven approach. The Jaccard index is used to measure actual and functional diversity of regional beer recipe ingredients and the flavor compounds they contain. We identified highly prevalent ingredients, and found them to reflect many common vintage beer recipe ingredients. We also identified regionally authentic ingredients, and found that the cultural traditions of the region are represented within those ingredients. Overall, hops offered the most regional authenticity to the recipes. Aroma preferences for hops from Europe and North America are outlined, along with regional tendencies to share flavor molecules in beer recipe ingredients.",,Social and behavioural science,3,Doheum Park,Culture Technology,Humanities,"I am currently a PhD candidate student at Graduate School of Culture Technology in KAIST.

Trade patterns in international fishery markets,"Global trade is a driver of the state of present ecosystems, but the mechanisms through which trade affects ecosystems remains poorly understood. Seafood is one of the most globally integrated food commodities with 40% traded internationally. The increasing globalization of trade in marine products has been pointed to as a potential reason for the overexploitation of wild stocks. Traders can establish new trade relations with other countries which means there is less incentive for the conservation of local resources. We analyzed patterns in trade relations and stock status in exporting countries using global trade and stock assessment databases. We analyzed the evolution of the trade networks of several stocks over time and found increased connectivity and an expanding trade network, though the overall volume of traded stocks stayed relatively stable. Whole networks changed significantly over the years and shared very little similarity (~20%) between years. The 100 and 25 most connected nodes within these networks, however, stayed more stable over time (~50-60 percent similar). In the future we will explore the changing networks by using tools for anomaly detection as well as descriptive network statistics to investigate the patterns that enable the sequential/serial exploitation of marine stocks.

"Quantifying and comparing “memory” in biological, ecological, physical, and socio-economic systems","Most real-world systems demonstrate in their behavior some degree of dependence on past behavior and conditions, or some capacity to store information about the past in their dynamics. This ”memory” of a system, be it cognitive or ecological, cultural or physical, has vital implications for those who wish to infer and predict the states and behavior of that system. Each discipline defines memory in its own way, as legacy effects, information transmitted from past to future, information stored in a process, cross-generational response to stimulus, etc. We use an information theoretic framework to unite these definitions and attempt to draw useful comparisons between systems spanning the biological, physical, and social spheres. To do this, we worked with epsilon machines (εM), a type of hidden Markov model in which the states represent causal pasts. We used a technique known as causal state splitting reconstruction (CSSR) to infer these machines from both synthetic data and real-world observations. To develop an inferential basis for statistical complexity using the εM approach, we performed benchmarking experiments, and showed that statistical complexity is positively correlated with memory strength and the pattern is consistent across most realistic perturbation levels and alphabet sizes. We then applied this approach to time series data of precipitation, soil moisture, game theory, animal movement, net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE), and coral reef metabolism. Within and across these systems, the relationship between estimated entropy rate (randomness/unpredictability of the time series) and statistical complexity follows the expected bell-shape, with the highest statistical complexity occurring at intermediate unpredictability (Figure 1). With the cases of soil moisture, game theory, and NEE, we also highlight the usage of statistical complexity as a criterion for determine suitability of process-based system models.",,Computing; Physical sciences,10,Yael Gurevich,Biology,Life sciences,"I'm a PhD student of theoretical biology.

Topological analysis of idealized and empirical fitness landscapes,"In this work, we provide such summary statistics using the tools of topological data analysis, in particular based on the technique of persistent homology. We adapt the methods of persistent homology to the lattice structure of fitness landscapes and define two cubical complex filtrations reflecting two different notions of landscape complexity, one capturing local optima and trap-like “bumpy” landscape geometry, and the other capturing epistasis and dependencies between different mutations. We demonstrate that the topological invariants we compute resolve the full range of landscape complexity produced by the mathematical NK and Rough Mount Fuji models of “tunably rugged” landscapes. We then apply the same methods to a large dataset of empirical transcription factor binding affinity landscapes, extending the results of a recent work on simpler summary statistics of these landscapes. We argue that the barcode and Betti number plots of persistence diagrams popular in the persistent homology literature give a finergrained description of landscape complexity than numerical summary statistics. To further demonstrate the usefulness of these descriptions, we use the notions of bottleneck and Wasserstein distance between persistence diagrams to define a metric structure on fitness landscapes, and describe how clustering in this metric space relates to conventional categorizations of transcription factors.",,Life sciences; Mathematics and statistics,2,Ximo Pechuan,Biology,Life sciences,"Research in theoretical evolutionary biology with the ultimate aim of generating a precise language to understand the deterministic component of the evolutionary process, regardless of the particularities of the biosphere that implements it.

Agent-Based Prediction Competition,"We independently propose an Agent-Based Prediction Competition. We generate synthetic data from a financial market ABM. We then try to predict the stock prices out-of-sample, by employing other ABMs, a dynamical system and statistical models. Our goal is to check whether prediction is at all possible, and whether more complex models (such as the other ABMs) outperform simpler or statistical models. We show that in this case, a single realization of the ABM cannot be reliably predicted at all with any of the tested methods. A substantial level of noise casts a strong limit on the predictive power of the models. Considering the average realization of the out-of-sample stock prices, complex ABMs outperform simpler ABMs, dynamical systems and statistical methods. However, this result is not statistically significant due to the noise level. We conclude that for future research, it is necessary to design an ABM in which realistic assumptions increase the signal to noise ratio.",,Social and behavioural science; Computing,8,Yael Gurevich,Biology,Life sciences,"I'm a PhD student of theoretical biology.

Inferring Functional Taxonomy from Network Structure,"The projection of bipartite graphs has proven to be a useful tool to infer similarity measures between nodes of either one of the node types, based on how many links they share with nodes of another type. In economics this has lead to the concept of the product space (Hidalgo et al. 2007), which is a network that connects products based on their co-locations in different countries. The relatedness between products in this networks is thought to be representative of the ’capabilities’ that are required to produce such products. Here we apply similar concepts to plant-pollinator networks and evaluate the results in light of natural history. By projecting plant-pollinator networks onto plant-plant and pollinator-pollinator networks, we aim to derive a measure of relatedness between plants based on the ecological traits that a pollinator must have to feed on it, and likewise a measure of relatedness between pollinators in terms of the traits they share, that allow them to feed on the same plants. By running community detection algorithms on the projected networks we create a functional taxonomy based on these (unobserved) ecological traits, and compare this taxonomy to taxonomies based on observable traits. As opposed to evolutionary taxonomies, our inferred taxonomies can represent a ’partner space,’ describing how plants see their pollinator community in terms of their capabilities and vice versa. Trait-based community detection formalizes the concept of ’pollination syndromes,’ the idea that pollinators in a pollination network with similar traits prefer similar plants with similar traits (e.g. flies pollinators prefer white-flowered plants) (Willmer 2011). We find that detected communities (Figure 1) are well-aligned with pollination guilds formed from field observations of flower visitors but that most basic (empirically-recorded) plant traits are not predictive of the communities observed from the projected plant-pollinator networks, suggesting that other traits play a significant role in plant choice for pollinators. This indicates the non-trivial nature of the communities identified by looking at plant-pollinator networks, reinforces criticisms of pollination syndromes, and may inspire future ecological research such as the identification of characteristic ecological traits that form these communities.",,Life sciences; Computing,4,Carla Rivera,"Biology, Ecology",Life sciences,I was born in Uruguay.

Behavioral footprints of depression from mobile-phone usage patterns,"Depression is increasingly prevalent in society. Alone, it a↵ects over 16.1 million American adults and is today the single most pervasive mental illness in the world. Many efforts trying to address this problem leverage technological advancements such as smartphones and smart tracking devices, to facilitate patient self-reporting for use in analyses that can aid medical experts. However, patients frequently ”drop out” or do not self-report, likely a behavior caused by their perpetual depression. This begs the invention of reporting mechanisms that do not rely on active participation from the patient. In this paper, we investigate the relationships between behavioral indicators, measured from smartphone activity, and depression in a large population of highly interconnected young adults. We find that depression correlates strongly with features that indicate social activity, communicational responsiveness and academic attendance. Using this insight we construct a simple classification model that predicts, from their set of behavioral indicators, whether an individual is more or less depressed than the population median. Our results have implications to the future of depression treatment. For example, using a classification model based on the features we highlight here, alerting systems could be built to help counteract the onset of depression in individuals.",,Health,6,Aaron Schwartz,Ecology,Life sciences,"My work is at the intersection of global ecological change and human health.

Inferring Functional Taxonomy from Network Structure,"The projection of bipartite graphs has proven to be a useful tool to infer similarity measures between nodes of either one of the node types, based on how many links they share with nodes of another type. In economics this has lead to the concept of the product space (Hidalgo et al. 2007), which is a network that connects products based on their co-locations in different countries. The relatedness between products in this networks is thought to be representative of the ’capabilities’ that are required to produce such products. Here we apply similar concepts to plant-pollinator networks and evaluate the results in light of natural history. By projecting plant-pollinator networks onto plant-plant and pollinator-pollinator networks, we aim to derive a measure of relatedness between plants based on the ecological traits that a pollinator must have to feed on it, and likewise a measure of relatedness between pollinators in terms of the traits they share, that allow them to feed on the same plants. By running community detection algorithms on the projected networks we create a functional taxonomy based on these (unobserved) ecological traits, and compare this taxonomy to taxonomies based on observable traits. As opposed to evolutionary taxonomies, our inferred taxonomies can represent a ’partner space,’ describing how plants see their pollinator community in terms of their capabilities and vice versa. Trait-based community detection formalizes the concept of ’pollination syndromes,’ the idea that pollinators in a pollination network with similar traits prefer similar plants with similar traits (e.g. flies pollinators prefer white-flowered plants) (Willmer 2011). We find that detected communities (Figure 1) are well-aligned with pollination guilds formed from field observations of flower visitors but that most basic (empirically-recorded) plant traits are not predictive of the communities observed from the projected plant-pollinator networks, suggesting that other traits play a significant role in plant choice for pollinators. This indicates the non-trivial nature of the communities identified by looking at plant-pollinator networks, reinforces criticisms of pollination syndromes, and may inspire future ecological research such as the identification of characteristic ecological traits that form these communities.",,Life sciences; Computing,4,Kayla Sale,Ecology,Life sciences,"My lifetime research goal is to better understand and predict how networks of species interactions conspire to effect (1) the fates of species lineages, (2) ecosystem services, and (3) changes in species abundances over time.

"Quantifying and comparing “memory” in biological, ecological, physical, and socio-economic systems","Most real-world systems demonstrate in their behavior some degree of dependence on past behavior and conditions, or some capacity to store information about the past in their dynamics. This ”memory” of a system, be it cognitive or ecological, cultural or physical, has vital implications for those who wish to infer and predict the states and behavior of that system. Each discipline defines memory in its own way, as legacy effects, information transmitted from past to future, information stored in a process, cross-generational response to stimulus, etc. We use an information theoretic framework to unite these definitions and attempt to draw useful comparisons between systems spanning the biological, physical, and social spheres. To do this, we worked with epsilon machines (εM), a type of hidden Markov model in which the states represent causal pasts. We used a technique known as causal state splitting reconstruction (CSSR) to infer these machines from both synthetic data and real-world observations. To develop an inferential basis for statistical complexity using the εM approach, we performed benchmarking experiments, and showed that statistical complexity is positively correlated with memory strength and the pattern is consistent across most realistic perturbation levels and alphabet sizes.

Hops across cultural boundaries: a regional analysis of beer recipe ingredients and their pairing principles,"Brewing beer has come to be regarded as a form of art, yet the consumption of beer is a cultural-specific phenomenon that evolves regionally. In the United States, for example, commercially available beers have drastically increased in number and style over the course of the last 30 years. Here we quantify diversity in beer brewing within and across different regions of the globe using a data-driven approach. The Jaccard index is used to measure actual and functional diversity of regional beer recipe ingredients and the flavor compounds they contain. We identified highly prevalent ingredients, and found them to reflect many common vintage beer recipe ingredients. We also identified regionally authentic ingredients, and found that the cultural traditions of the region are represented within those ingredients. Overall, hops offered the most regional authenticity to the recipes. Aroma preferences for hops from Europe and North America are outlined, along with regional tendencies to share flavor molecules in beer recipe ingredients.",,Social and behavioural science,3,Bleu Knight,"Biology, Computer Science",Life sciences; Computing,"My PhD research is focused on the differentiation of naïve neural cell types using methods that traverse through the disciplines of bioengineering, neuroscience, and bioinformatics.

Topological analysis of idealized and empirical fitness landscapes,"In this work, we provide such summary statistics using the tools of topological data analysis, in particular based on the technique of persistent homology. We adapt the methods of persistent homology to the lattice structure of fitness landscapes and define two cubical complex filtrations reflecting two different notions of landscape complexity, one capturing local optima and trap-like “bumpy” landscape geometry, and the other capturing epistasis and dependencies between different mutations. We demonstrate that the topological invariants we compute resolve the full range of landscape complexity produced by the mathematical NK and Rough Mount Fuji models of “tunably rugged” landscapes. We then apply the same methods to a large dataset of empirical transcription factor binding affinity landscapes, extending the results of a recent work on simpler summary statistics of these landscapes. We argue that the barcode and Betti number plots of persistence diagrams popular in the persistent homology literature give a finergrained description of landscape complexity than numerical summary statistics. To further demonstrate the usefulness of these descriptions, we use the notions of bottleneck and Wasserstein distance between persistence diagrams to define a metric structure on fitness landscapes, and describe how clustering in this metric space relates to conventional categorizations of transcription factors.",,Life sciences; Mathematics and statistics,2,Tim Kunisky,Mathematics,Mathematics and statistics,"I am a PhD student in mathematics at the Courant Institute at NYU, interested in applying probability theory to understanding statistical and computational techniques for working with massive datasets, including specific applications arising in biology and social sciences.

We show that in this case, a single realization of the ABM cannot be reliably predicted at all with any of the tested methods. A substantial level of noise casts a strong limit on the predictive power of the models. Considering the average realization of the out-of-sample stock prices, complex ABMs outperform simpler ABMs, dynamical systems and statistical methods.

Delay reconstruction and ARMA models used influenza-like-illness (ILI) surveillance data from 1997-2017 in the United States.

Each model's fit to ILI data (black line) is summarized in the figure below across the four prediction horizons. Overall, ARMA models (teal), more accurately predicted ILI than the method of analogues (salmon), especially when the prediction horizon was 1-2 weeks. The method of analogues with a single nearest neighbor predicted slightly better than the ARMA model for 3-4 weeks; however, a very large delay vector was required.

"Quantifying and comparing “memory” in biological, ecological, physical, and socio-economic systems","Most real-world systems demonstrate in their behavior some degree of dependence on past behavior and conditions, or some capacity to store information about the past in their dynamics. This ”memory” of a system, be it cognitive or ecological, cultural or physical, has vital implications for those who wish to infer and predict the states and behavior of that system. Each discipline defines memory in its own way, as legacy effects, information transmitted from past to future, information stored in a process, cross-generational response to stimulus, etc. We use an information theoretic framework to unite these definitions and attempt to draw useful comparisons between systems spanning the biological, physical, and social spheres. To do this, we worked with epsilon machines (εM), a type of hidden Markov model in which the states represent causal pasts. We used a technique known as causal state splitting reconstruction (CSSR) to infer these machines from both synthetic data and real-world observations. To develop an inferential basis for statistical complexity using the εM approach, we performed benchmarking experiments, and showed that statistical complexity is positively correlated with memory strength and the pattern is consistent across most realistic perturbation levels and alphabet sizes. We then applied this approach to time series data of precipitation, soil moisture, game theory, animal movement, net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE), and coral reef metabolism. Within and across these systems, the relationship between estimated entropy rate (randomness/unpredictability of the time series) and statistical complexity follows the expected bell-shape, with the highest statistical complexity occurring at intermediate unpredictability (Figure 1).

Classification of dragon-king phases in preferential attachment and failure models,"A new case of a preferential attachment model is considered. The probability that an already existing node in a network acquires a link to a new node is proportional to the product of its intrinsic fitness and its degree. We enrich this already known model by preferential deletion, which removes nodes at random with probability proportional to their fitness to some exponent ω. Under ‘normal’ conditions, the resulting node degree distribution is an asymptotic power-law (scale-free regime). We derive an exact condition for a phase transition after which one or a few nodes capture a finite fraction of all links in the infinite networks (dragonking regime). By approximately ‘parametrizing’ the space of fitness distributions through the beta-density, we then show phasediagrams that separate the two regimes.",,Computing; Mathematics and statistics,2,Sandro Lera,"Physics, Economics",Physical sciences; Social and behavioural science,"My background is in theoretical physics.

Trade patterns in international fishery markets,"Global trade is a driver of the state of present ecosystems, but the mechanisms through which trade affects ecosystems remains poorly understood. Seafood is one of the most globally integrated food commodities with 40% traded internationally. The increasing globalization of trade in marine products has been pointed to as a potential reason for the overexploitation of wild stocks. Traders can establish new trade relations with other countries which means there is less incentive for the conservation of local resources. We analyzed patterns in trade relations and stock status in exporting countries using global trade and stock assessment databases. We analyzed the evolution of the trade networks of several stocks over time and found increased connectivity and an expanding trade network, though the overall volume of traded stocks stayed relatively stable. Whole networks changed significantly over the years and shared very little similarity (~20%) between years. The 100 and 25 most connected nodes within these networks, however, stayed more stable over time (~50-60 percent similar). In the future we will explore the changing networks by using tools for anomaly detection as well as descriptive network statistics to investigate the patterns that enable the sequential/serial exploitation of marine stocks. We hope that these efforts will culminate in a network model or exponential random graph that describes the underlying mechanisms that cause sequential overexploitation of marine populations.",,Business and administration; Agriculture and forestry and fishery,7,Junfu Zhao,Economics,Social and behavioural science,"I am a PhD student in economics in University of Utah.

We attempted to generate emergent computation with a CA using a genetic algorithm, with the aim of understanding general conditions on information processing dynamics which increase computational capacity. Specifically, we aim to search the space of CAs to identify minimal computational units, which may in turn be used to execute specific computational tasks or optimize further search for collective computational behavior. In order to select for CAs with more computational capacity, we use an objective function defined in terms of dual total correlation (DTC), an information-theoretic quantity capturing the information in higher-order correlations between cells in a given spatial (and temporal) region of the time-dependent CA grid. The genetic algorithm evolves a population of CA update rules by testing average performance over a range of initial conditions, creating a new population favoring more successful rules, and iterating over a number of generations.",,Computing,5,Mark Kirstein,Economics,Social and behavioural science,"I am a PhD candidate in economics at TU Dresden, hold a diploma in business and information systems from Leipzig University and spent a semester abroad at ETH Zurich to attend mainly econophysics lectures and talks.

Behavioral footprints of depression from mobile-phone usage patterns,"Depression is increasingly prevalent in society. Alone, it a↵ects over 16.1 million American adults and is today the single most pervasive mental illness in the world. Many efforts trying to address this problem leverage technological advancements such as smartphones and smart tracking devices, to facilitate patient self-reporting for use in analyses that can aid medical experts. However, patients frequently ”drop out” or do not self-report, likely a behavior caused by their perpetual depression. This begs the invention of reporting mechanisms that do not rely on active participation from the patient. In this paper, we investigate the relationships between behavioral indicators, measured from smartphone activity, and depression in a large population of highly interconnected young adults. We find that depression correlates strongly with features that indicate social activity, communicational responsiveness and academic attendance. Using this insight we construct a simple classification model that predicts, from their set of behavioral indicators, whether an individual is more or less depressed than the population median. Our results have implications to the future of depression treatment. For example, using a classification model based on the features we highlight here, alerting systems could be built to help counteract the onset of depression in individuals.",,Health,6,Freya Casier,Economics,Social and behavioural science,"Economist with interest in gender, social gerontology and cooperative organization.",,Female,Researcher,The Danish National Centre for Social Research,Denmark,2017,Santa Fe,Jackie,

A Quantitative Approach to Contact Improvisation Dance,"Partner improvisation is characterized by prediction, adaptation and emergent outcomes that are
unique to the pair. These definitions have not been stringently applied to improvisational dance,
therefore we propose a way to measure the influence of partners on the emergent movements of
each other. As a pilot study, we use a simple alphabet of body contact (torso, arms, legs) to code
3 videos of improvisation pairs. We record the point of contact for each partner, and then use this
information to compute measures of mutual information and entropy rate. We find that mutual

"Nighttime Light, Superlinear Growth, and Economic Inequalities at the Country Level","Research has highlighted relationships between size and scaled growth across a large variety of biological and social organisms, ranging from bacteria, through animals and plants, to cities an companies. Yet, heretofore, identifying a similar relationship at the country level has proven challenging. One reason is that, unlike the former, countries have predefined borders, which limit their ability to grow “organically.” This paper addresses this issue by identifying and validating an effective measure of organic growth at the country level: nighttime light emissions, which serve as a proxy of energy allocations where more productive activity takes place. This indicator is compared to population size to illustrate that while nighttime light emissions are associated with superlinear growth, population size at the country level is associated with sublinear growth. These relationships and their implications for economic inequalities are then explored using high-resolution geospatial datasets spanning the last three decades.",,Architecture and building; Mathematics and statistics,2,Laura Mann,Computer Science,Computing,Laura Mann is a software developer at JPL.,,Female,Government,NASA,United States,2018,Santa Fe,Jackie,

A Quantitative Approach to Contact Improvisation Dance,"Partner improvisation is characterized by prediction, adaptation and emergent outcomes that are
unique to the pair. These definitions have not been stringently applied to improvisational dance,
therefore we propose a way to measure the influence of partners on the emergent movements of
each other. As a pilot study, we use a simple alphabet of body contact (torso, arms, legs) to code
3 videos of improvisation pairs. We record the point of contact for each partner, and then use this
information to compute measures of mutual information and entropy rate. We find that mutual
information between partners is higher as the level of the improvisation grows, which is consistent
with our understanding of prediction in improvisation. Our study finds that the level of experience
in contact improvisation of the annotator makes a difference when scoring the contact between

Less work has been done, however, on describing the individual steps of abstraction taken in the course of biomimicry innovation efforts. Studying this question can add to an understanding of how the process of replicating or mimicking nature works in practice, and whether successful outcomes result from similar inputs. Here we begin to address this gap by compiling a database of the most widely discussed biomimicry applications.

Characterizing Atrial Fibrillation Dynamics using Multiplex Visibility Graphs,"We performed simulations of normal rhythm and fibrillatory dynamics using the mono-domain formulation of the Rogers and McCulloch model. Clinical data were recorded from 4 patients with atrial fibrillation before and after successful catheter ablation procedure using a multi-electrode basket catheter. From multivariate times series of simulated and clinical data, we constructed multiplex visibility graphs. We then compared the structural properties of multiplex visibility graphs between time series from healthy and fibrillatory rhythms. For both simulations and clinical data, the giant component of the multiplex visibility graph was higher in time series of normal rhythm compared to time series of fibrillatory rhythms. The structural efficiency of the multiplex graphs was higher in normal rhythm compared to fibrillatory rhythms. Multiplex visibility graphs provide novel insights in cardiac dynamics, paving the way for a more in-depth characterization of fibrillatory rhythms. In particular, normal sinus rhythm is associated with multiplex visibility graphs that have greater connectivity and structural efficiency compared to fibrillatory dynamics. Our long-term goal is to develop a network-based method that could be used to define procedural end-points and identify alternative therapeutic targets.",,Health,4,Konstantinos Aronis,Medicine,Health,"I am a cardiology fellow at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.

Aiming to contribute to this characterization we study time series of activity in simulated heart tissue. We use Bayesian structural inference to find the best fit models in a set of hidden Markov models representing renewal processes. We compute the entropy rate and statistical complexity of these models and compare between results for healthy heart activity, heart activity at the onset of the phase transition and heart activity after the phase transition.

Fluctuations in 1D Point Patterns,"Random point patterns with similar apparent characteristics (such as density of points) may display very different behaviours when it comes to the way these points are distributed in space. Strongly negatively correlated points (e.g. due to repulsive forces) show a high degree of order, whereas strongly positively correlated points (e.g. due to attractive forces) show clustering and hence, a high degree of disorder. These two extreme cases define a spectrum where point patterns are classified according to their fluctuations from small fluctuations (order, hyperuniformity) to large fluctuations (disorder, clustering). Point patterns with weak correlations show the same trend in their fluctuations as the typical uncorrelated case and are said to display Poisson-like behaviour. In this report, we show numerical results on different one-dimensional point patterns both computer generated and experimentally obtained (heartbeat recordings). Furthermore, we regard the case of anomalously suppressed fluctuations (hyperuniformity) as a case of special interest and we try to derive the underlying mechanisms that give rise to this behaviour. We study the Dirichlet distribution as a model that can be tuned to display any behaviour from a periodic signal to a clustered signal.",,Mathematics and statistics,4,Konstantinos Aronis,Medicine,Health,"I am a cardiology fellow at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.

A Quantitative Approach to Contact Improvisation Dance,"Partner improvisation is characterized by prediction, adaptation and emergent outcomes that are
unique to the pair. These definitions have not been stringently applied to improvisational dance,
therefore we propose a way to measure the influence of partners on the emergent movements of
each other. As a pilot study, we use a simple alphabet of body contact (torso, arms, legs) to code
3 videos of improvisation pairs. We record the point of contact for each partner, and then use this
information to compute measures of mutual information and entropy rate. We find that mutual
information between partners is higher as the level of the improvisation grows, which is consistent
with our understanding of prediction in improvisation. Our study finds that the level of experience
in contact improvisation of the annotator makes a difference when scoring the contact between
partners. Entropy rate calculations have a big bias due to shortage of data, and do not distinguish
between the pairs of dancers.",,Arts,6,Vandana Revathi Venkateswaran,Biology,Life sciences,"I did my Bachelors of Science (Physics) from Delhi University.

Scaling of Sensory Information Intake in Organisms,"The metabolic resources required by organisms are known to scale with their mass raised to the 3/4 power. Like energy and nutrients, information about the environment is also a necessary resource for life. However, little attention has been placed on how the capacity to absorb information scales with size. We have taken steps toward answering this question by a) synthesizing data on sensory capacity from multiple organisms to try and answer the question empirically and b) exploring theoretical considerations that might allow us to deduce the scaling laws from first principles. We hypothesize that as organisms increase in size and complexity, their sensory capacity per unit mass decreases, owing to the fact that less total information is needed if it can be processed in a more sophisticated manner. Preliminary results, both theoretical and empirical, are supportive of this claim. In particular, we derive a fundamental bound on the sensory capacity of a spherical cell arising from the heat it dissipates, which turns out to be a linear function of the cell radius r. As the mass of a cell scales as r3, our bound implies that the maximum achievable channel capacity per unit mass decreases with the size of the organism. We also investigate the hypothesis that organisms at all scales devote a fixed fraction of their metabolic rate to gathering sensory information, and find tentative support for this claim.",,Life sciences,2,Louisa Jane Di Felice,Ecology,Life sciences,"I'm a PhD student at the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology in Barcelona.

Fluctuations in 1D Point Patterns,"Random point patterns with similar apparent characteristics (such as density of points) may display very different behaviours when it comes to the way these points are distributed in space. Strongly negatively correlated points (e.g. due to repulsive forces) show a high degree of order, whereas strongly positively correlated points (e.g. due to attractive forces) show clustering and hence, a high degree of disorder. These two extreme cases define a spectrum where point patterns are classified according to their fluctuations from small fluctuations (order, hyperuniformity) to large fluctuations (disorder, clustering). Point patterns with weak correlations show the same trend in their fluctuations as the typical uncorrelated case and are said to display Poisson-like behaviour. In this report, we show numerical results on different one-dimensional point patterns both computer generated and experimentally obtained (heartbeat recordings). Furthermore, we regard the case of anomalously suppressed fluctuations (hyperuniformity) as a case of special interest and we try to derive the underlying mechanisms that give rise to this behaviour. We study the Dirichlet distribution as a model that can be tuned to display any behaviour from a periodic signal to a clustered signal.",,Mathematics and statistics,4,Carlos Marcelo,Ecology,Life sciences,"2nd year PhD Student in Ecology and Evolution, working in the Allesina lab.

Translating from Nature to Technology: Framework to Compare Innovation Pathways in Biomimicry,"Biomimicry is a growing area of research that seeks to abstract functions and architectures observed in nature to solve problems in science and engineering. Previous studies have documented biomimicry efforts in individual subfields, and discussed the philosophical foundations of biomimicry as a sustainability-oriented innovation strategy. Less work has been done, however, on describing the individual steps of abstraction taken in the course of biomimicry innovation efforts. Studying this question can add to an understanding of how the process of replicating or mimicking nature works in practice, and whether successful outcomes result from similar inputs. Here we begin to address this gap by compiling a database of the most widely discussed biomimicry applications. We use this database to develop a conceptual framework to describe the process through which biological phenomena have been translated into technologies (Fig. 1).",,Life sciences; Engineering,3,Sarah J.

Talking Loud Or Talking Often: How the Interplay Between Network Structure and Agent Influence Affects the Time to Reach Consensus in Collective Decision-Making,"Consensus-seeking processes are core mechanisms for social organization in non-human animal groups, human societies, artificial and multi-agent systems. Such processes consist of a series of negotiations between individuals, which ultimately aggregate different individual opinions into one common agreed decision. Related works have shown that a small number of influential and highly centralized agents i.e. leaders, considerably speed up the consensus-seeking process. Yet the important features of hierarchy and leaders have not been clearly identified and their investigation in experiments provide contradictory evidence. To disentangle these effects, we separate two features of hierarchy (i) the level of centralization ν and (ii) the number of leaders NL, i.e. influential individuals. We therefore developed a continuous opinion formation model to explore the effect of each feature and their interplay on the time to reach a global consensus. The results show that the most important feature is the topology of the network structure, with higher centralization always decreasing the time to reach consensus. In addition, it also demonstrates that the effect of influential individuals are deeply entangled with the underlying network structure. Indeed, it can be beneficial to have a few leaders if the structure is centralized, but surprisingly it can also be detrimental if the population is homogeneous. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation of the “babble” hypothesis which stresses the importance of talkativeness and extraversion of leaders. Further directions involve a full characterization of the main mechanisms leading to polarization or fragmentation as final states in more complex network structures, such as modular structures with nested hierarchies.",,Social and behavioural science,4,Cedric Perret,"Biology, Computer Science",Life sciences; Computing,"I am a French guy doing my 2nd year of PhD on the evolutionary origins of social organization.

Characterizing Atrial Fibrillation Dynamics using Multiplex Visibility Graphs,"We performed simulations of normal rhythm and fibrillatory dynamics using the mono-domain formulation of the Rogers and McCulloch model. Clinical data were recorded from 4 patients with atrial fibrillation before and after successful catheter ablation procedure using a multi-electrode basket catheter. From multivariate times series of simulated and clinical data, we constructed multiplex visibility graphs. We then compared the structural properties of multiplex visibility graphs between time series from healthy and fibrillatory rhythms. For both simulations and clinical data, the giant component of the multiplex visibility graph was higher in time series of normal rhythm compared to time series of fibrillatory rhythms. The structural efficiency of the multiplex graphs was higher in normal rhythm compared to fibrillatory rhythms. Multiplex visibility graphs provide novel insights in cardiac dynamics, paving the way for a more in-depth characterization of fibrillatory rhythms. In particular, normal sinus rhythm is associated with multiplex visibility graphs that have greater connectivity and structural efficiency compared to fibrillatory dynamics.

Characterization of the underlying physical mechanisms may lead to better prediction of the onset of this phase transition and enable efficient treatment of patients at risk.

We use Bayesian structural inference to find the best fit models in a set of hidden Markov models representing renewal processes.

Collective Information Processing in Human Rumor Spreading Networks: An experimental Study of Rumor Content Fusion and Propagation,"We posit that this difference is largely due to the fact that classical laboratory experiments do not take into account complex interaction mechanisms in human societies. Namely, ways in which groups can combine noisy information to reduce overall uncertainty.

Mean First Saturation Time (MFST) and its Application to Refugee Movement," In this network, nodes are cities or refugee camps, and edges denote the distance between them. We model refugees as random walkers who are biased towards the refugee camps which can hold sj people. To determine the source nodes (i) and the initial number of random walkers (n), we use data on where the conflicts happened and the number of refugees that arrive at any camp under a twomonth period after the start of the conflict. With such information, we divide the early stage of the Burundi 2015 conflict into two waves of refugees. Using the first wave of refugees we calibrate the biased parameter β of the random walk to best match the distribution of refugees on the camps. Then, we test the prediction of the distribution of refugees in camps for the second wave using the same biased parameters. Our results show that the biased random walk can capture, to some extent, the distribution of refugees in different camps (see figure 1). Finally, we test the probability of saturation for various camps.

Analysis of Neural Networks Based on Global and Local Sampling of RNA Sequences,"In this work, we use a new sampling approach where we first uniformly sample sequences from different distant parts of the sequence space using RNARedPrint. We then increase the size of the network by locally sampling sequences around each of the sequences sampled at first. In order to keep the network in a reasonable size, we additionally constrain the neutrality criterion such that not only the secondary structure but also the value of its folding energy is considered, using only the lowest 5% of folding energy values. This is done for three different type of structures, an artificial short hairpin structure, a Hammerhead ribozyme and a tRNA. We analyze the structure of the resulting networks and compare with already existing work. We are able to confirm earlier results and show that our sampling technique helps to explore distinct parts of the fitness landscape. We also show that local minima consist of more than one sequence and low folding energy sequences are spread throughout the network and separated by sequences with higher folding energy.",,Life sciences,4,Alice C.

information between partners is higher as the level of the improvisation grows, which is consistent

Scaling of Sensory Information Intake in Organisms,"The metabolic resources required by organisms are known to scale with their mass raised to the 3/4 power. Like energy and nutrients, information about the environment is also a necessary resource for life. However, little attention has been placed on how the capacity to absorb information scales with size. We have taken steps toward answering this question by a) synthesizing data on sensory capacity from multiple organisms to try and answer the question empirically and b) exploring theoretical considerations that might allow us to deduce the scaling laws from first principles. We hypothesize that as organisms increase in size and complexity, their sensory capacity per unit mass decreases, owing to the fact that less total information is needed if it can be processed in a more sophisticated manner. Preliminary results, both theoretical and empirical, are supportive of this claim. In particular, we derive a fundamental bound on the sensory capacity of a spherical cell arising from the heat it dissipates, which turns out to be a linear function of the cell radius r. As the mass of a cell scales as r3, our bound implies that the maximum achievable channel capacity per unit mass decreases with the size of the organism. We also investigate the hypothesis that organisms at all scales devote a fixed fraction of their metabolic rate to gathering sensory information, and find tentative support for this claim.",,Life sciences,2,Elan Stopnitzky,Physics,Physical sciences,"My research sits at the intersection of information theory, statistical physics, and biology.

Fluctuations in 1D Point Patterns,"Random point patterns with similar apparent characteristics (such as density of points) may display very different behaviours when it comes to the way these points are distributed in space. Strongly negatively correlated points (e.g. due to repulsive forces) show a high degree of order, whereas strongly positively correlated points (e.g. due to attractive forces) show clustering and hence, a high degree of disorder. These two extreme cases define a spectrum where point patterns are classified according to their fluctuations from small fluctuations (order, hyperuniformity) to large fluctuations (disorder, clustering). Point patterns with weak correlations show the same trend in their fluctuations as the typical uncorrelated case and are said to display Poisson-like behaviour. In this report, we show numerical results on different one-dimensional point patterns both computer generated and experimentally obtained (heartbeat recordings). Furthermore, we regard the case of anomalously suppressed fluctuations (hyperuniformity) as a case of special interest and we try to derive the underlying mechanisms that give rise to this behaviour.

Talking Loud Or Talking Often: How the Interplay Between Network Structure and Agent Influence Affects the Time to Reach Consensus in Collective Decision-Making,"Consensus-seeking processes are core mechanisms for social organization in non-human animal groups, human societies, artificial and multi-agent systems. Such processes consist of a series of negotiations between individuals, which ultimately aggregate different individual opinions into one common agreed decision. Related works have shown that a small number of influential and highly centralized agents i.e. leaders, considerably speed up the consensus-seeking process. Yet the important features of hierarchy and leaders have not been clearly identified and their investigation in experiments provide contradictory evidence. To disentangle these effects, we separate two features of hierarchy (i) the level of centralization ν and (ii) the number of leaders NL, i.e. influential individuals. We therefore developed a continuous opinion formation model to explore the effect of each feature and their interplay on the time to reach a global consensus. The results show that the most important feature is the topology of the network structure, with higher centralization always decreasing the time to reach consensus. In addition, it also demonstrates that the effect of influential individuals are deeply entangled with the underlying network structure. Indeed, it can be beneficial to have a few leaders if the structure is centralized, but surprisingly it can also be detrimental if the population is homogeneous. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation of the “babble” hypothesis which stresses the importance of talkativeness and extraversion of leaders. Further directions involve a full characterization of the main mechanisms leading to polarization or fragmentation as final states in more complex network structures, such as modular structures with nested hierarchies.",,Social and behavioural science,4,Guillaume St-Onge,"Physics, Network Science",Physical sciences; Computing,"PhD candidate in Physics and Network Science at Laval University in Quebec, Canada.

Industrial Economic and Spatial Clustering in Singapore,"Using the clustering network detected in the first stage of the study, we examined the relationship between economic linkages
and spatial clustering across and within industrial sectors. To address this, cluster matching analysis was conducted to study
the strength of the relationship between both types of clustering network. This study found that the economic and geographical
clustering activity exhibit global similarity of approximately 0.6, which suggests that on a broad level, the economic linkages and
spatial clustering of industrial sectors tend to be correlated. Lastly, pairwise asymmetric comparison between industries in the
broad sector was proposed to evaluate if industries grouped together in the spatial cluster were also grouped together in the
economic clusters.",,Social and behavioural science; Architecture and building,5,Sanna Ojanpera,"International Development, Data",Social and behavioural science,"Sanna is a DPhil Student at the OII and also a doctoral student at the Alan Turing Institute, where she leads the Data and Inequality interest group together with her supervisor Mark Graham.",,Female,Student,University of Oxford,United Kingdom,2018,Santa Fe,Jackie,
A Quantitative Approach to Contact Improvisation Dance,"Partner improvisation is characterized by prediction, adaptation and emergent outcomes that are
unique to the pair. These definitions have not been stringently applied to improvisational dance,
therefore we propose a way to measure the influence of partners on the emergent movements of
each other. As a pilot study, we use a simple alphabet of body contact (torso, arms, legs) to code
3 videos of improvisation pairs. We record the point of contact for each partner, and then use this
information to compute measures of mutual information and entropy rate. We find that mutual
information between partners is higher as the level of the improvisation grows, which is consistent
with our understanding of prediction in improvisation. Our study finds that the level of experience
in contact improvisation of the annotator makes a difference when scoring the contact between
partners. Entropy rate calculations have a big bias due to shortage of data, and do not distinguish
between the pairs of dancers.",,Arts,6,Alexandra Mikhailova,Neuroscience,Social and behavioural science,I am a PhD student in neuroscience at UC Davis.

Translating from Nature to Technology: Framework to Compare Innovation Pathways in Biomimicry,"Biomimicry is a growing area of research that seeks to abstract functions and architectures observed in nature to solve problems in science and engineering. Previous studies have documented biomimicry efforts in individual subfields, and discussed the philosophical foundations of biomimicry as a sustainability-oriented innovation strategy. Less work has been done, however, on describing the individual steps of abstraction taken in the course of biomimicry innovation efforts. Studying this question can add to an understanding of how the process of replicating or mimicking nature works in practice, and whether successful outcomes result from similar inputs. Here we begin to address this gap by compiling a database of the most widely discussed biomimicry applications. We use this database to develop a conceptual framework to describe the process through which biological phenomena have been translated into technologies (Fig. 1).",,Life sciences; Engineering,3,Alexandra Mikhailova,Neuroscience,Social and behavioural science,I am a PhD student in neuroscience at UC Davis.

"Nighttime Light, Superlinear Growth, and Economic Inequalities at the Country Level","Research has highlighted relationships between size and scaled growth across a large variety of biological and social organisms, ranging from bacteria, through animals and plants, to cities an companies. Yet, heretofore, identifying a similar relationship at the country level has proven challenging. One reason is that, unlike the former, countries have predefined borders, which limit their ability to grow “organically.” This paper addresses this issue by identifying and validating an effective measure of organic growth at the country level: nighttime light emissions, which serve as a proxy of energy allocations where more productive activity takes place. This indicator is compared to population size to illustrate that while nighttime light emissions are associated with superlinear growth, population size at the country level is associated with sublinear growth. These relationships and their implications for economic inequalities are then explored using high-resolution geospatial datasets spanning the last three decades.",,Architecture and building; Mathematics and statistics,2,Ore Koren,Political Science,Social and behavioural science,"I am a pre-doctoral fellow at the Dickey Center at Dartmouth College, and a former Jennings Randolph Peace Scholar at the United States Institute of Peace, specializing in international relations and methodology.

Collective Information Processing in Human Rumor Spreading Networks: An experimental Study of Rumor Content Fusion and Propagation,"We posit that this difference is largely due to the fact that classical laboratory experiments do not take into account complex interaction mechanisms in human societies. Namely, ways in which groups can combine noisy information to reduce overall uncertainty. We design an experimental setup intended to allow the observation and quantification of such mechanisms, which have been shown to be important in other collective information processing systems. The effect of feedback introduced into the rumor spreading process through redundant transmission pathways in a network structure is investigated. The scale of our experiments is not large enough to give statistically significant results with regards to the importance of network structure However, motif analysis of our results shows that non-trivial information fusion mechanisms are employed by human participants when presented with con accounts of a rumor. We hope that the work presented in this report will pave the way to future experiments and models of information fusion, which will allow us to quantify how human societies collectively process information in the form of rumors.",,Social and behavioural science; Computing,6,Javier Garcia-Bernardo,Political Science,Social and behavioural science,"Javier Garcia-Bernardo is a PhD candidate in Political Science at the CORPNET project.

The individual lives of microbial cells: evolution of phenotypic diversity in a bacterial population,"Scientists tend to appreciate microbes for their simplicity and predictability: if you put a population of genetically identical cells in a uniform environment, we assume they will all behave in the same way. However, in many cases this assumption is catastrophically wrong. We're frequently discovering new examples of clonal microbial populations that show diversity in a particular phenotype-- say, growth rate, substrate preference, or antibiotic tolerance-- in a way that is seemingly stochastic (not a case of plasticity in response to the environment). In some cases, this diversity may simply be noise with little consequence for the ecology of the population. In others, it seems to be an evolved trait, often in response to environmental stress, that confers increased fitness on the population as a whole even if some individuals are not behaving in an optimal way. How does phenotypic heterogeneity evolve? In what environments is it advantageous for all cells to behave the same way, and in what environments is diversity beneficial? How does the nature of the environmental stress influence the shape of the phenotypic distribution that will evolve? Can we call it ""bet-hedging"" or ""division of labor""?

Why proteins? Mutations are the source of evolutionary novelty. Without evolutionary novelty, an organism will struggle to adapt to an alternating environment. Simultaneously, mutations are perceived to mostly be deleterious, causing negative fitness effects. Effectively, we are facing an evolutionary balance act between maintaining current functionality (selection against deleterious mutations), but also incorporating novelty (mutations, diversity) in order to stay opt in a constantly alternating environment. So, how can a systems incorporate novel information, without breaking the current functionality? You can think of proteins as a network of friends, and friends who introduce you to new friends.

Evaluating Two Mechanisms for the Evolution of Social Complexity,"Theorists from Herbert Spencer to Brian Arthur assert that evolution drives an upward spiral of complexity, but the devil's in the details.

However, a large body of work illustrates that meaning is multimodal; i.e. words gain their meaning through their use in embodied multimodal contexts as labels that refer to “sensory images” – a property of meaning long known to artists, as in the use of visual imagery to inspire linguistically-mediated interpretations in the domain of painting, or in the use of words to evoke mental representations of sensory images in the domain of poetry. Here we propose a method for automated textual analysis that clusters words not based on text-to-text relations, but rather, in text-to-image relations, based on the structure of the sensory images associated with words. Specifically, we develop an automated approach for using large-scale search data from Google to retrieve a continuous set of images associated with search terms, and we provide information-theoretic measures for clustering search terms based on similarities in the color profile (such as ‘palette’) of . We explore how this clustering method can reveal novel dimensions of meaning previously unavailable through purely text-based methods of automated text analysis, for example, by finding unexpected similarities among search terms based on their color profile, or by providing novel measures for how abstract a word is based on the diversity of images associated with its use as a search term.",,Computing; Social and behavioural science,6,Ruggiero Lo Sardo,,Health,Ruggiero is working on his PhD in the EU Horizon 2020 SmartResilience.

Chaotic Brain,"Some of us are looking at chaos in the brain and how state-transitions in EEG waves may relate to learning/uncertainty-reduction/entropy. This refers to what Liz mentioned on day 1, where EEG waves of a healthy brain displayed a qualitative change in dynamics (bifurcation) when a parameter was changed, i.e., from *chaotic to more periodic*, under the influence of specific drugs. We also learned that the rabbit brain, when remembering a familiar smell as opposed to an unfamiliar smell, displayed a switch from chaotic to periodic attractor. We are asking the question of what other events may trigger a qualitative change in dynamics from chaotic to periodic, e.g., meditation, sleep or flow experiences, and what they have in common? The first step is to scan the literature.

Secondly, could it be that the above bifurcations in the brain correspond to human learning and reducing uncertainty in the sense of information theory, i.e., where a state of higher unfamiliarity and novelty corresponds to more chaotic states and familiarity to more periodic states?",,Social and behavioural science; Physical science,7,Keith Smith,,Mathematics and statistics; Health,"I focus on developing mathematical tools to illuminate hidden interdependencies of large biomedical datasets that will help to understand disease processes and enhance classification strategies.

Evolution of Cells' Decision to Divide,"How do cells decide when is the right time to divide? From a purely efficiency-based perspective, cells can obtain nutrients at a rate proportional to their surface area, but nutrient requirement for growth has a rate proportional to volume of the cell. Thus, there will be a cell size that is optimum for division.

The problem with this reasoning is, cells will tend to divide at the same size on average, irrespective of their initial size. But we know that in most bacterial species, cells that start out small (large) tend to divide at a size smaller (larger) than the average size at division.

This indicates there is a different reason behind cells’ decision to divide. It is an optimal path chosen by evolution, and I intend to simulate cells susceptible to mutations under different conditions to understand how this division mechanism arises through evolution and why it is optimal.",,Life science,2,Kunaal Joshi,,Physical science; Life science,"I study biophysics in the Department of Physics and Astronomy.

Modelling the spatial diffusion of human language,"The diversification of human languages is a bit like speciation in biology: using comparative and cladistic methods, linguists can group languages into language families and further subgroup them into ""phylogenetic"" trees or networks. At the same time, we know where these languages are spoken today. The question, then: putting these two sources of data together, can we model the diffusion of languages over physical space and work backwards from the present day to infer the most likely homelands of the corresponding protolanguages? Can the predictions of such a model be made to align what we otherwise know about human migrations in the past?
