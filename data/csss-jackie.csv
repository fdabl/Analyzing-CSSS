An Individualist Theory of Collective Knowledge Creation,,,Social and behavioural science,3,Melissa Eitzel,Data Science,Mathematics and statistics,"I am an NSF postdoctoral fellow at the Science and Justice Research Center at the University of California, Santa Cruz. My research integrates qualitative and quantitative methods to understand resilience in a socio-ecosystem in rural Zimbabwe. I am working with a 30 year dataset which includes information on many components of the system, including livestock production, agricultural production, woodland use, and human demography. My goal for my time at the Santa Fe Institute is to think about how to model this complex system's actual and potential dynamics. Ultimately I want to create a tool the community can use for land use planning. My dissertation focused on sophisticated statistical models for forest data and historical aerial imagery, and in previous lives I was a physicist and a seismologist. Also I like cats.",,Female,Postdoc,University of California Santa Cruz,United States,2015,Santa Fe,Possibly published

An Individualist Theory of Collective Knowledge Creation,,,Social and behavioural science,3,Anna Zaytseva,Information Systems,Computing,"I am doing my PhD in Information Systems at the University of Oslo in Norway (3rd year), and soon I am going to get my degree. I apply the approach of Complex Adaptive Systems to generate a stepwise method to study mutual shaping between technologies and law, so the space in between those two – at the edge – is in focus. That space is a CAS with memory. I have two case studies of radically different e-health technologies of Norway, and each case has an own CAS. A CAS initially consists of about a hundred to almost a thousand smallest elements depending on the scale of a case. The elements are legal as norms & values, technologic as technical & conceptual, and social in situ & ex situ for the design work. Having appeared once, the elements of each CAS re-appear in time and increase in quantity to several thousand, what makes the memories be path-dependent and highly interconnected inside. Although the research is completely qualitative, manual and bottom-up, it provides a non-linear analysis of the phenomenon of mutual shaping between technologies and law with large visual representations at each subsequent step conducted in accordance with rules, which I have generated from one case study and replicated in another. In my method, I trace causalities in the CAS(s) and test a hypothesis whether attractors in the legal environment are shared among the design works on those technologies. Three attractors from four vs. six are shared, whereas the remaining ones invite a third case study. Unique technical implications in specific shapes and their information loops with the legal environment are indicated and the reasons explained. The research provides a transdisciplinary path for studying the complexity between law and technologies and calls specialists in the local fields – law, design studies and organization science – to examine the findings in detail by use of their own discipline methodologies.

My own initial background is in law, which I got at the National Research University – Higher School of Economics in Russia, and I wrote my Master’s thesis on policy analysis of standardization in six innovation markets of the European Union, what I did at Linköping University in Sweden. Besides, I have work experience both in public and private organizations. I am very interested in technologies and their architectures, as well as approaches to anticipate future. I have my own home library in Complexity Science that I consider to be advanced transdisciplinary methodology in harmony with nature. Therefore, at CSSS 2015 I am particularly interested to learn more about emerging transdisciplinary approaches for data analysis, where meanings behind words play crucial role. I am also concerned about visualization issues, co-evolution phenomena, bottom-up analytic strategies for complex systems research, information theory aspects, and simplicity behind the variety of self-organization forms. I vote for proper respect of sciences to each other, their synthesis and tight international collaboration, what I want to work for. So, I am also looking for colleagues and friends.",,Female,Student,University of Oslo,Norway,2015,Santa Fe,Possibly published

Complex Systems Techniques applied to Power Transmission Expansion Planning,"Choosing how new lines should be installed in a power grid, or Transmission Expansion Planning (TEP) is a problem of considerable complexity. Any power grid has a large number (hundreds to tens of thousands) of components, meaning that any upgrades must take into account the current infrastructure. Additionally, there are many possible additional lines that one could add to an existing power grid. Furthermore, any design must be weighted by investment and operation cost.

Mapping Complexity/Human Knowledge as a Complex Adaptive System,,,Computing,2,Anna Zaytseva,Information Systems,Computing,"I am doing my PhD in Information Systems at the University of Oslo in Norway (3rd year), and soon I am going to get my degree. I apply the approach of Complex Adaptive Systems to generate a stepwise method to study mutual shaping between technologies and law, so the space in between those two – at the edge – is in focus. That space is a CAS with memory. I have two case studies of radically different e-health technologies of Norway, and each case has an own CAS. A CAS initially consists of about a hundred to almost a thousand smallest elements depending on the scale of a case. The elements are legal as norms & values, technologic as technical & conceptual, and social in situ & ex situ for the design work. Having appeared once, the elements of each CAS re-appear in time and increase in quantity to several thousand, what makes the memories be path-dependent and highly interconnected inside. Although the research is completely qualitative, manual and bottom-up, it provides a non-linear analysis of the phenomenon of mutual shaping between technologies and law with large visual representations at each subsequent step conducted in accordance with rules, which I have generated from one case study and replicated in another. In my method, I trace causalities in the CAS(s) and test a hypothesis whether attractors in the legal environment are shared among the design works on those technologies. Three attractors from four vs. six are shared, whereas the remaining ones invite a third case study. Unique technical implications in specific shapes and their information loops with the legal environment are indicated and the reasons explained. The research provides a transdisciplinary path for studying the complexity between law and technologies and calls specialists in the local fields – law, design studies and organization science – to examine the findings in detail by use of their own discipline methodologies.

My own initial background is in law, which I got at the National Research University – Higher School of Economics in Russia, and I wrote my Master’s thesis on policy analysis of standardization in six innovation markets of the European Union, what I did at Linköping University in Sweden. Besides, I have work experience both in public and private organizations. I am very interested in technologies and their architectures, as well as approaches to anticipate future. I have my own home library in Complexity Science that I consider to be advanced transdisciplinary methodology in harmony with nature. Therefore, at CSSS 2015 I am particularly interested to learn more about emerging transdisciplinary approaches for data analysis, where meanings behind words play crucial role. I am also concerned about visualization issues, co-evolution phenomena, bottom-up analytic strategies for complex systems research, information theory aspects, and simplicity behind the variety of self-organization forms. I vote for proper respect of sciences to each other, their synthesis and tight international collaboration, what I want to work for. So, I am also looking for colleagues and friends.",,Female,Student,University of Oslo,Norway,2015,Santa Fe,Published: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cplx.21799

An Interdisciplinary Approach to Morphogenesis,,,,4,Lars Hubatsch,Physics,Physical sciences,"Originally trained as a physicist, I am now working on biological pattern formation at the Francis Crick Institute in London, UK, for my PhD. In our lab we focus on the PAR protein network, which can set up an axis within a single cell, thus deciding where the cell has its front and rear ends. This requires going back and forth between live imaging of cell polarity proteins and trying to explain the behaviour we see via mathematical modelling. I spend a lot of time on experiments and quantification, and a little less time thinking about the theoretical aspects of pattern forming protein networks. Therefore, CSSS seemed like a good breakout to come away with a deeper understanding of (emergent) network behaviour. When I am not thinking about front and rear ends, I really enjoy sports (in particular rock climbing and outdoorsy stuff), which I try to combine with travelling (often to some of the coolest climbing crags, definitely taking my climbing shoes to Santa Fe!).",,Male,Student,Francis Crick Institute,United Kingdom,2016,Santa Fe,

My Master in research was on the subject of Freudian Overdetermination in the light of the scientific revolutions brought on by Complex Systems and Chaos, in addition to Ilya Prigogine’s contributions.

I have been doing clinical work in institutions and private practice since 2007, and have also worked on the field of prevention, doing harm reduction talks and workshops, as well as statistics. I have spoken publicly (radio and television, public gatherings and seminars) and have presented scientific communications on my research around the world (so far in France, Australia and Mexico).

Research interests
My research interests aim at integrating dynamical and complex systems’ views in psychology (epistemology-wise as well as in clinical practice). I particularly focus on fractals and their relation to psychoanalysis and psychic phenomena in clinical settings, but also taking into account neuroscience, sociology, linguistics and behavior. Outside of traditional human sciences, I have focused on fractals, attractors, self-similarity, nodes, dissipative systems, phase transitions and feedback loops. This multidisciplinary approach sheds light on clinical treatment, repetition, symptoms, projection, bodily manifestations and psychopathological structures such as autism, psychosis, neurosis and their relation to the culture they are engrained in.

Current Research
I am currently doing my PH.D. at the Center for Research in Psychoanalysis, Medicine and Society at the University of Paris 7, Sorbonne-Cité, Denis-Diderot. My focus is on Fractals and the Psyche; repetition, structure and self-similarity. This research contributes to clinical, as well as epistemological aspects in the field of psychology. Fractals seem to be a key to understanding repetitive symptoms and maladaptive response systems, crucial factors for the efficiency of therapy. On the other hand, I strive to integrate recent developments of complex systems, chaos theory, and specifically fractal geometry in my field. Some efforts to explore this multidisciplinary junction have already been explored around the world with promising results, but it seems we have just seen the tip of the iceberg in a field where there is still much to do.

My research deals mainly with the spatiotemporal characterization of small and large-scale self-organized dynamical systems (earthquakes and granular avalanches). The approach I use is based on a generalized method of constructing a temporally directed network, wherein events are connected based on their spatial separations. By looking at the degree distribution and other features of the network, one can infer the possible presence of causal structure in the system (patterns in space and time, i.e foreshocks and aftershocks). I also do experiments on granular avalanches, and I analyze them using a series of image and video processing algorithms. Although I mainly do complexity science research, I'm also fond of machine learning and data science.

I have spoken publicly (radio and television, public gatherings and seminars) and have presented scientific communications on my research around the world (so far in France, Australia and Mexico).

Research interests
My research interests aim at integrating dynamical and complex systems’ views in psychology (epistemology-wise as well as in clinical practice). I particularly focus on fractals and their relation to psychoanalysis and psychic phenomena in clinical settings, but also taking into account neuroscience, sociology, linguistics and behavior. Outside of traditional human sciences, I have focused on fractals, attractors, self-similarity, nodes, dissipative systems, phase transitions and feedback loops. This multidisciplinary approach sheds light on clinical treatment, repetition, symptoms, projection, bodily manifestations and psychopathological structures such as autism, psychosis, neurosis and their relation to the culture they are engrained in.

Current Research
I am currently doing my PH.D. at the Center for Research in Psychoanalysis, Medicine and Society at the University of Paris 7, Sorbonne-Cité, Denis-Diderot. My focus is on Fractals and the Psyche; repetition, structure and self-similarity. This research contributes to clinical, as well as epistemological aspects in the field of psychology. Fractals seem to be a key to understanding repetitive symptoms and maladaptive response systems, crucial factors for the efficiency of therapy. On the other hand, I strive to integrate recent developments of complex systems, chaos theory, and specifically fractal geometry in my field. Some efforts to explore this multidisciplinary junction have already been explored around the world with promising results, but it seems we have just seen the tip of the iceberg in a field where there is still much to do.

Opportunistic attachment assembles plant–pollinator networks,"Species and interactions are being lost at alarming rates and it is imperative to understand how communities assemble if we have to prevent their collapse and restore lost interactions. Using an
8-year dataset comprising nearly 20 000 pollinator visitation records, we explore the assembly of plant–pollinator communities at native plant restoration sites in an agricultural landscape. We
find that species occupy highly dynamic network positions through time, causing the assembly process to be punctuated by major network reorganisations. The most persistent pollinator species
are also the most variable in their network positions, contrary to what preferential attachment – the most widely studied theory of ecological network assembly – predicts. Instead, we suggest

Human Path Finding in a Semantic Word Game,"Human decision-making processes are inevitably influenced by mental images, which are triggered by cues such as objects,

minimal number of steps. We construct models to capture human paths within the MindPaths game. We find that similarity in

Bayesian estimation of transition probabilities conditional on local network connectivity. We find that it is difficult to capture the

Our goal is to check whether prediction is at all possible, and whether more complex models (such as the other ABMs) outperform simpler or statistical models. We show that in this case, a single realization of the ABM cannot be reliably predicted at all with any of the tested methods. A substantial level of noise casts a strong limit on the predictive power of the models. Considering the average realization of the out-of-sample stock prices, complex ABMs outperform simpler ABMs, dynamical systems and statistical methods.

Inferring Functional Taxonomy from Network Structure,"The projection of bipartite graphs has proven to be a useful tool to infer similarity measures between nodes of either one of the node types, based on how many links they share with nodes of another type. In economics this has lead to the concept of the product space (Hidalgo et al. 2007), which is a network that connects products based on their co-locations in different countries. The relatedness between products in this networks is thought to be representative of the ’capabilities’ that are required to produce such products. Here we apply similar concepts to plant-pollinator networks and evaluate the results in light of natural history. By projecting plant-pollinator networks onto plant-plant and pollinator-pollinator networks, we aim to derive a measure of relatedness between plants based on the ecological traits that a pollinator must have to feed on it, and likewise a measure of relatedness between pollinators in terms of the traits they share, that allow them to feed on the same plants. By running community detection algorithms on the projected networks we create a functional taxonomy based on these (unobserved) ecological traits, and compare this taxonomy to taxonomies based on observable traits. As opposed to evolutionary taxonomies, our inferred taxonomies can represent a ’partner space,’ describing how plants see their pollinator community in terms of their capabilities and vice versa. Trait-based community detection formalizes the concept of ’pollination syndromes,’ the idea that pollinators in a pollination network with similar traits prefer similar plants with similar traits (e.g. flies pollinators prefer white-flowered plants) (Willmer 2011). We find that detected communities (Figure 1) are well-aligned with pollination guilds formed from field observations of flower visitors but that most basic (empirically-recorded) plant traits are not predictive of the communities observed from the projected plant-pollinator networks, suggesting that other traits play a significant role in plant choice for pollinators. This indicates the non-trivial nature of the communities identified by looking at plant-pollinator networks, reinforces criticisms of pollination syndromes, and may inspire future ecological research such as the identification of characteristic ecological traits that form these communities.",,Life sciences; Computing,4,Carla Rivera,"Biology, Ecology",Life sciences,I was born in Uruguay.

As opposed to evolutionary taxonomies, our inferred taxonomies can represent a ’partner space,’ describing how plants see their pollinator community in terms of their capabilities and vice versa. Trait-based community detection formalizes the concept of ’pollination syndromes,’ the idea that pollinators in a pollination network with similar traits prefer similar plants with similar traits (e.g. flies pollinators prefer white-flowered plants) (Willmer 2011). We find that detected communities (Figure 1) are well-aligned with pollination guilds formed from field observations of flower visitors but that most basic (empirically-recorded) plant traits are not predictive of the communities observed from the projected plant-pollinator networks, suggesting that other traits play a significant role in plant choice for pollinators.

Inferring Functional Taxonomy from Network Structure,"The projection of bipartite graphs has proven to be a useful tool to infer similarity measures between nodes of either one of the node types, based on how many links they share with nodes of another type. In economics this has lead to the concept of the product space (Hidalgo et al. 2007), which is a network that connects products based on their co-locations in different countries. The relatedness between products in this networks is thought to be representative of the ’capabilities’ that are required to produce such products.

To do this, I try to quantify how knowledge recombines, the distance between knowledge and the complexity of knowledge using network and information theory. In practice, knowledge is measured through e.g. products, services, patents or occupations. Relatedness can then be measured through co-location or co-classifications, and complexity can be measured by for example the ease of recombination. I am also interested in explaining why complex knowledge scales with city size (in other words, is concentrated in space). I do this by measuring interdependencies between occupations and trying to quantify synergies and redundancies between occupations.

Trade patterns in international fishery markets,"Global trade is a driver of the state of present ecosystems, but the mechanisms through which trade affects ecosystems remains poorly understood.

Traders can establish new trade relations with other countries which means there is less incentive for the conservation of local resources. We analyzed patterns in trade relations and stock status in exporting countries using global trade and stock assessment databases. We analyzed the evolution of the trade networks of several stocks over time and found increased connectivity and an expanding trade network, though the overall volume of traded stocks stayed relatively stable. Whole networks changed significantly over the years and shared very little similarity (~20%) between years.

We compared a traditional influenza forecasting method (an autoregressive moving average [ARMA] model) with a nearest neighbor forecasting approach (the Lorenz Method of Analogues), where nearest neighbors were identified from a reconstructed state space using delay coordinate embedding. Delay reconstruction and ARMA models used influenza-like-illness (ILI) surveillance data from 1997-2017 in the United States. We compared model forecasts of the 2015-2017 influenza seasons across 1-4 week prediction horizons. Each model's fit to ILI data (black line) is summarized in the figure below across the four prediction horizons. Overall, ARMA models (teal), more accurately predicted ILI than the method of analogues (salmon), especially when the prediction horizon was 1-2 weeks. The method of analogues with a single nearest neighbor predicted slightly better than the ARMA model for 3-4 weeks; however, a very large delay vector was required. Future directions will include exploring other methods to incorporate nearest neighbors into the method of analogues and combining both autoregressive and nearest neighbor approaches.",,Health; Computing,6,Spencer Fox,Epidemiology,Health,"I am a 4th year PhD student at UT Austin with Dr. Lauren Ancel Meyers studying epidemiology (understanding disease dynamics).

"Quantifying and comparing “memory” in biological, ecological, physical, and socio-economic systems","Most real-world systems demonstrate in their behavior some degree of dependence on past behavior and conditions, or some capacity to store information about the past in their dynamics. This ”memory” of a system, be it cognitive or ecological, cultural or physical, has vital implications for those who wish to infer and predict the states and behavior of that system. Each discipline defines memory in its own way, as legacy effects, information transmitted from past to future, information stored in a process, cross-generational response to stimulus, etc. We use an information theoretic framework to unite these definitions and attempt to draw useful comparisons between systems spanning the biological, physical, and social spheres. To do this, we worked with epsilon machines (εM), a type of hidden Markov model in which the states represent causal pasts. We used a technique known as causal state splitting reconstruction (CSSR) to infer these machines from both synthetic data and real-world observations. To develop an inferential basis for statistical complexity using the εM approach, we performed benchmarking experiments, and showed that statistical complexity is positively correlated with memory strength and the pattern is consistent across most realistic perturbation levels and alphabet sizes. We then applied this approach to time series data of precipitation, soil moisture, game theory, animal movement, net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE), and coral reef metabolism. Within and across these systems, the relationship between estimated entropy rate (randomness/unpredictability of the time series) and statistical complexity follows the expected bell-shape, with the highest statistical complexity occurring at intermediate unpredictability (Figure 1).

"Quantifying and comparing “memory” in biological, ecological, physical, and socio-economic systems","Most real-world systems demonstrate in their behavior some degree of dependence on past behavior and conditions, or some capacity to store information about the past in their dynamics. This ”memory” of a system, be it cognitive or ecological, cultural or physical, has vital implications for those who wish to infer and predict the states and behavior of that system. Each discipline defines memory in its own way, as legacy effects, information transmitted from past to future, information stored in a process, cross-generational response to stimulus, etc. We use an information theoretic framework to unite these definitions and attempt to draw useful comparisons between systems spanning the biological, physical, and social spheres. To do this, we worked with epsilon machines (εM), a type of hidden Markov model in which the states represent causal pasts. We used a technique known as causal state splitting reconstruction (CSSR) to infer these machines from both synthetic data and real-world observations. To develop an inferential basis for statistical complexity using the εM approach, we performed benchmarking experiments, and showed that statistical complexity is positively correlated with memory strength and the pattern is consistent across most realistic perturbation levels and alphabet sizes. We then applied this approach to time series data of precipitation, soil moisture, game theory, animal movement, net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE), and coral reef metabolism.

Behavioral footprints of depression from mobile-phone usage patterns,"Depression is increasingly prevalent in society. Alone, it a↵ects over 16.1 million American adults and is today the single most pervasive mental illness in the world. Many efforts trying to address this problem leverage technological advancements such as smartphones and smart tracking devices, to facilitate patient self-reporting for use in analyses that can aid medical experts. However, patients frequently ”drop out” or do not self-report, likely a behavior caused by their perpetual depression. This begs the invention of reporting mechanisms that do not rely on active participation from the patient. In this paper, we investigate the relationships between behavioral indicators, measured from smartphone activity, and depression in a large population of highly interconnected young adults. We find that depression correlates strongly with features that indicate social activity, communicational responsiveness and academic attendance. Using this insight we construct a simple classification model that predicts, from their set of behavioral indicators, whether an individual is more or less depressed than the population median.

information between partners is higher as the level of the improvisation grows, which is consistent

A Quantitative Approach to Contact Improvisation Dance,"Partner improvisation is characterized by prediction, adaptation and emergent outcomes that are
unique to the pair. These definitions have not been stringently applied to improvisational dance,
therefore we propose a way to measure the influence of partners on the emergent movements of
each other. As a pilot study, we use a simple alphabet of body contact (torso, arms, legs) to code
3 videos of improvisation pairs. We record the point of contact for each partner, and then use this
information to compute measures of mutual information and entropy rate. We find that mutual
information between partners is higher as the level of the improvisation grows, which is consistent
with our understanding of prediction in improvisation. Our study finds that the level of experience
in contact improvisation of the annotator makes a difference when scoring the contact between
partners. Entropy rate calculations have a big bias due to shortage of data, and do not distinguish
between the pairs of dancers.",,Arts,6,Gianrocco Lazzari,"Physics, Public Health",Physical sciences; Health,"After a MSc in theoretical physics in Utrecht (NL), I moved to biology in Basel (CH) for a short period.

Analysis of Neural Networks Based on Global and Local Sampling of RNA Sequences,"In this work, we use a new sampling approach where we first uniformly sample sequences from different distant parts of the sequence space using RNARedPrint. We then increase the size of the network by locally sampling sequences around each of the sequences sampled at first.

Characterizing Atrial Fibrillation Dynamics using Multiplex Visibility Graphs,"We performed simulations of normal rhythm and fibrillatory dynamics using the mono-domain formulation of the Rogers and McCulloch model. Clinical data were recorded from 4 patients with atrial fibrillation before and after successful catheter ablation procedure using a multi-electrode basket catheter. From multivariate times series of simulated and clinical data, we constructed multiplex visibility graphs.

For both simulations and clinical data, the giant component of the multiplex visibility graph was higher in time series of normal rhythm compared to time series of fibrillatory rhythms. The structural efficiency of the multiplex graphs was higher in normal rhythm compared to fibrillatory rhythms. Multiplex visibility graphs provide novel insights in cardiac dynamics, paving the way for a more in-depth characterization of fibrillatory rhythms.

Fluctuations in 1D Point Patterns,"Random point patterns with similar apparent characteristics (such as density of points) may display very different behaviours when it comes to the way these points are distributed in space. Strongly negatively correlated points (e.g. due to repulsive forces) show a high degree of order, whereas strongly positively correlated points (e.g. due to attractive forces) show clustering and hence, a high degree of disorder. These two extreme cases define a spectrum where point patterns are classified according to their fluctuations from small fluctuations (order, hyperuniformity) to large fluctuations (disorder, clustering). Point patterns with weak correlations show the same trend in their fluctuations as the typical uncorrelated case and are said to display Poisson-like behaviour. In this report, we show numerical results on different one-dimensional point patterns both computer generated and experimentally obtained (heartbeat recordings). Furthermore, we regard the case of anomalously suppressed fluctuations (hyperuniformity) as a case of special interest and we try to derive the underlying mechanisms that give rise to this behaviour.

"Nighttime Light, Superlinear Growth, and Economic Inequalities at the Country Level","Research has highlighted relationships between size and scaled growth across a large variety of biological and social organisms, ranging from bacteria, through animals and plants, to cities an companies. Yet, heretofore, identifying a similar relationship at the country level has proven challenging. One reason is that, unlike the former, countries have predefined borders, which limit their ability to grow “organically.” This paper addresses this issue by identifying and validating an effective measure of organic growth at the country level: nighttime light emissions, which serve as a proxy of energy allocations where more productive activity takes place. This indicator is compared to population size to illustrate that while nighttime light emissions are associated with superlinear growth, population size at the country level is associated with sublinear growth.

Scaling of Sensory Information Intake in Organisms,"The metabolic resources required by organisms are known to scale with their mass raised to the 3/4 power. Like energy and nutrients, information about the environment is also a necessary resource for life. However, little attention has been placed on how the capacity to absorb information scales with size. We have taken steps toward answering this question by a) synthesizing data on sensory capacity from multiple organisms to try and answer the question empirically and b) exploring theoretical considerations that might allow us to deduce the scaling laws from first principles. We hypothesize that as organisms increase in size and complexity, their sensory capacity per unit mass decreases, owing to the fact that less total information is needed if it can be processed in a more sophisticated manner. Preliminary results, both theoretical and empirical, are supportive of this claim. In particular, we derive a fundamental bound on the sensory capacity of a spherical cell arising from the heat it dissipates, which turns out to be a linear function of the cell radius r. As the mass of a cell scales as r3, our bound implies that the maximum achievable channel capacity per unit mass decreases with the size of the organism. We also investigate the hypothesis that organisms at all scales devote a fixed fraction of their metabolic rate to gathering sensory information, and find tentative support for this claim.",,Life sciences,2,Louisa Jane Di Felice,Ecology,Life sciences,"I'm a PhD student at the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology in Barcelona.

Talking Loud Or Talking Often: How the Interplay Between Network Structure and Agent Influence Affects the Time to Reach Consensus in Collective Decision-Making,"Consensus-seeking processes are core mechanisms for social organization in non-human animal groups, human societies, artificial and multi-agent systems. Such processes consist of a series of negotiations between individuals, which ultimately aggregate different individual opinions into one common agreed decision. Related works have shown that a small number of influential and highly centralized agents i.e. leaders, considerably speed up the consensus-seeking process. Yet the important features of hierarchy and leaders have not been clearly identified and their investigation in experiments provide contradictory evidence. To disentangle these effects, we separate two features of hierarchy (i) the level of centralization ν and (ii) the number of leaders NL, i.e. influential individuals. We therefore developed a continuous opinion formation model to explore the effect of each feature and their interplay on the time to reach a global consensus. The results show that the most important feature is the topology of the network structure, with higher centralization always decreasing the time to reach consensus. In addition, it also demonstrates that the effect of influential individuals are deeply entangled with the underlying network structure. Indeed, it can be beneficial to have a few leaders if the structure is centralized, but surprisingly it can also be detrimental if the population is homogeneous. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation of the “babble” hypothesis which stresses the importance of talkativeness and extraversion of leaders.

Thresholding Normally Distributed Data Creates Complex Networks,"Network data sets are often constructed by some kind of thresholding procedure. The resulting networks frequently possess properties such as heavy-tailed degree distributions, non-zero clustering, large connected components and short average shortest path lengths. These properties are considered typical of complex networks and appear in many contexts, prompting consideration of their universality. Here we introduce a very simple model for continuous valued relational data and study the effect of thresholding it. We find that some, but not all, of the properties associated with complex networks can be seen after thresholding, even when the underlying data is not “complex”.",,Mathematics and statistics,7,Guillaume St-Onge,"Physics, Network Science",Physical sciences; Computing,"PhD candidate in Physics and Network Science at Laval University in Quebec, Canada.

Translating from Nature to Technology: Framework to Compare Innovation Pathways in Biomimicry,"Biomimicry is a growing area of research that seeks to abstract functions and architectures observed in nature to solve problems in science and engineering. Previous studies have documented biomimicry efforts in individual subfields, and discussed the philosophical foundations of biomimicry as a sustainability-oriented innovation strategy. Less work has been done, however, on describing the individual steps of abstraction taken in the course of biomimicry innovation efforts. Studying this question can add to an understanding of how the process of replicating or mimicking nature works in practice, and whether successful outcomes result from similar inputs. Here we begin to address this gap by compiling a database of the most widely discussed biomimicry applications. We use this database to develop a conceptual framework to describe the process through which biological phenomena have been translated into technologies (Fig. 1).",,Life sciences; Engineering,3,Sarah J. Berkemer,Bioinformatics,Life sciences; Computing,"I am a PhD student in Bioinformatics at Prof. Stadler's lab in Leipzig, Germany. I studied Bioinformatics as I like the mixture of different disciplines and topics. I am interested in theoretical topics such as the development of algorithms but I am also happy to analyze biological data (e.g sequencing data). I like to travel and get to know people, places and (working) cultures, hence I've spent two months in Bogota, Colombia and three months in Tokyo, Japan to collaborate with researchers.",,Female,Student,Leipzig University,Germany,2018,Santa Fe,

Understanding Music with Higher Order Networks,"Music is a natural complex system: notes interact in a sequential way to create melody and interact in a “vertical"" way with different instruments to create harmony; only with 12 notes, composers are able to create different styles and music genres. Simple networks have been used to model and analyze music. However, this representation assumes there are no dependencies between notes. To include these dependencies, we model musical pieces as a Higher Order Network (HON). In a higher order network, the dependencies between the nodes are encoded by using sequence of dependent notes as nodes.",,Arts,4,Josefine Bohr Brask,Animal Behavior,Life sciences,"I am a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Exeter, UK, working on social evolution in nature, in particular the evolution of cooperation.
