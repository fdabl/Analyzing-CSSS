Changes in Social Network Structure in Response to Crisis: Using Twitter data to Explore the Effect of the Tōhoku Earthquake,,Network Analysis,"Computing, Social and behavioural science",2,Christa Brelsford,Sustainability,Environmental protection,"I am a Ph.D candidate in the School of Sustainability at Arizona State University. I have an MA from the Climate and Society program at Columbia University, and a BS in civil engineering, also from Columbia. I'm also a research assistant in the Energy and Infrastructure group at the Los Alamos National Lab. My dissertation research focuses on how water allocation institutions have and may change in response to increasing scarcity. My main case study uses the water system in Las Vegas Nevada as an example of apparently successful adaptation to binding water scarcity. Although we don't yet have tools to reliably predict human behavior, in this political context, the choices made by water policy decision makers have a governing influence on the system, and can't be ignored. I hope that the computational tools used in complex systems research will help to integrate the rich social data I've gathered with the precise hydraulic models of the Colorado river water system that already exist.

My name is Piotr (Peter) and I'm a first year PhD student here, at the University of Warsaw. I graduated from a Physics Department with a specialization in Biomedical Physics. My MSc thesis concerned changes in human EEG during a visual stimulation, and I finished it during an internship in Philips Research Europe in Eindhoven (The Netherlands). I worked for some time on Brain-Computer Interfaces, but my PhD project deals more with modelling. For now, it evolves around a model that simulates epilepsy-attack behavior in an EEG signal. I'm trying to check if methods known from catastrophe theory can detect the onset of attacks. I'm hoping that CSSS will provide me with tools that will help me with this task. I'm quite proficient with mathematics and statistics (including some knowledge of stochastic (Markov) processes), signal analysis and have basic (but still growing) knowledge of the catastrophe theory (it is still somewhat new to me).

Small scale processes occur in various ecosystems and landscapes (e.g., periglacial ecosystems, microtopography in peatlands, vegetation patterns in drylands...). Such local heterogeneities are often important or even fundamental to better understand general and large scale properties of the system, but they are either ignored or poorly parameterized in regional and global circulation models (GCMs). A challenging problem is then how to deal with these interactions across different spatial scales, and how to improve our understanding of the role played by local soil heterogeneities in the climate system.

My interests are wide and include languages, dinosaurs, swimming, and pop dance from many times and cultures, especially contemporary Bhangra. My research focuses on two areas. One is the development of economic, political, and environmental games as critical research methods that promote players to reflect on their decisions and the development of norms, institutions, and sustainability. Key aspects in the development of these games have included offering alternatives to standard game theorietic assumptions of player rationality and finding ways to balance player motivations in ways that are neither purely cooperative nor purely competitive, leaving players with situations that feel less contrived and more like real life than most games. These games are systemic in nature, and players' choices have consequential effects on the system.

Using Habermas' theory of knowledge to understanding validity, bias, and reliability in research practice, this work suggests alternatives to positivist and post-positivist conceptions are, when dealing with normative issues, both desirable and necessary. This builds on Habermas' assertion that inquiry into positivist assumptions is not possible in positivist research since positivist research avoids inquiry into the interest laden domains that motivate positivist scholars.

I am interested in all kinds of questions related to a sustainable development of the world, in particular understanding extreme poverty, the factors driving it, what we can do about it, global justice and our responsibility for suffering in faraway places. My specific area of research is price transmission analysis. It looks at how price shocks are transmitted between various markets in different locations or between the world market and domestic markets, that is, for example, in which way recent price peaks for wheat or rice on the world market have affected people in developing countries. The current workhorse in this field is a type of time series model called threshold vector error correction model. The reasoning behind it is very intuitive when considering a pair of two markets, but -- at least to my mind -- does not appear appropriate when really these two markets form part of a larger network. Searching for a different set of tools to handle this extended setting is what got me interested in complex systems. This is completely new territory for me and I hope that during the course of this summer school I will be able to gain some understanding of this area of research and its potential applicability to price transmission analysis.

NA1,,NA,,5,Jasmeen Kanwal,Linguistics,Humanities,"Here's a bit of background about me: I just finished my first year of the PhD program in linguistics at UCSD. Before that, I did 2 years of a philosophy PhD program there, where I was interested in general philosophy of science and also philosophy of physics, particularly issues of emergence (classical dynamics from quantum, and the thermodynamic arrow of time from time-symmetric stat mech), and before that I got my undergraduate degree in Physics and Philosophy from Oxford (where, among other things, I did a project on the evolution of matter in the universe under various models of dark energy (!)). I won't go into the details of how I ended up shifting over to linguistics, but I'll just say a bit about my current interests. Broadly, I am interested in understanding why languages have the structures they do, both structure that is common to all languages (there is a lot less of this than one might think, but there are at least some very general commonalities) and those that seem to vary cross-linguistically. It seems to me that modeling language as a complex adaptive system is very apt, given the nature of language as an evolving system based in interactions between agents and constrained by many different factors (such as biology, cognitive abilities, information transmission pressures, and of course culture). Contrary to previous theories of language where most of the structure was thought to be due to some sort of innate language faculty, I want to explore to what extent it is possible to account for the structure and evolutionary behaviour of language by modelling it as a complex system, which depends on all the sorts of domain-general factors mentioned above, as well as domain-general learning mechanisms, such as statistical and analogical learning. I have a number of specific projects I'm just beginning to work on, but at the CSSS I'm mostly interested in gaining modelling tools that I can apply to building agent-based simulations of language learning and language evolution.

I am excited to hear about everyone's research and to have the opportunity to work on a project that might be a seed for future collaboration. One short story is that I'm interested in evolution, network science, mathematics, computer science, and language. A longer story is that in light of an internal struggle that I believe has explicitly confronted thinkers, at the least since Kant, my approach to research teeters about the fulcrum between rationalism and empiricism with respect to the order in which each is applied in attempts to cultivate knowledge. My scientific research interests began with synthetic biology and the study of bacterial quorum sensing and broadened from there to include systems biology and the evolution of multicellularity. I am now primarily interested in applying, as yet abstract, tools from mathematics and theoretical computer science to a mereological description of the evolution of hierarchical organization in biological systems that incorporates niche construction with selection in order to derive a more concrete computational model of such. In this context, and being at least a token ontological reductionist, I am also interested in the hierarchical relationship between information representation in molecular and linguistic forms as may be addressed at the level of abstraction of semiotics.

NA1,,NA,,5,Vanessa Ferdinand,Language Evolution,Humanities,"Background: Anthropology, Linguistics, Cognitive Science

Currently 2nd-year PhD student in Language Evolution at the University of Edinburgh

Interests: I'm interested in mapping out the evolutionary dynamics involved in cultural transmission systems. I also wonder whether general evolutionary frameworks for culture are possible, or if different transmission systems (ex: social network typology) or the cultural information that's being passed on (ex: language, music, religious beliefs) are too idiosyncratic to be lumped together and modeled generally.

Mainly, I research how the learning biases of individuals in a population map to the emergent structure of the language that they share - and look at how the transmission process itself modulates this. My master thesis addressed this problem with an iterated learning model of cultural transmission with Bayesian agents. Iterated learning models highlight language as a complex dynamic system that adapts to the environment which it propagates through; the environment here is the cognitive constraints of the humans (or agents) that learn and use the language. The main results we get for these types of models is that language becomes more learnable and structured via use.

I'd like to gain more tools to analyze these data sets with and as many outside perspectives on my work as possible.

Currently, I'm experimenting with human probability matching behavior and trying to formulate simple cognitive biases in terms of selection pressures in a culturally evolving systems. In particular, I'm searching for mechanisms and processes in social learning that can support the appearance of drift at the surface level of a culture: for example, counting up the number of different names that parents give their children each year is a surface level measure of cultural variation, where each variant is a baby name. And looking into the process by which parents actually choose their baby's name gives us a mechanistic understanding of how the variation we witness is generated.

Recent research is claiming that lots of cultural change over time just looks like drift. And generally, drift is something we try to formulate as a neutral model, which we would like to rule out to see if the change we witness is due to something more interesting then just sampling error - but to something like a selection pressure due to the functionality or fitness of one cultural variant over another. However, it is questionable whether true drift processes occur in cultural evolution: what could possibly be an ""uninteresting"" change that occurs for a system that must replicate by passing through human cognition? That's a great question...",,Female,PhD Student,University of Edinburgh,UK,2012,Santa Fe,
NA2,,NA,,2,Xue Feng,Sustainability,Environmental protection,"My project now revolves around the ""sustainability of seasonally dry ecosystems."" In more practical terms, I would like study how organisms and people cope (and thrive) in places where the supply of essential water resources (in the form of rainfall) is unpredictable both in terms of the amount and of its temporal distribution. This issue of unpredictability, or randomness in time, is manifested at multiple time scales--from the daily to the interannual--which all compound to the challenge of trying to maximize effective water use.

My latest project is in trying to quantify the level of rainfall seasonality in the tropics by decomposing time series.

Eventually I would like to look at how such rainfall variability, as a dominant ecological force, is propagated through different levels in the ecosystem. And whether a variety of coping strategies, both from nature (e.g., drought avoidance and deciduousness) and from human management (e.g., irrigation, fertilization), can help to stablize the ecosystem against unforeseen extreme events (e.g., fire, disease, catastrophic climate change). In other words, how does the diversity of responses contribute to the resilience of the ecosystem?

NA2,,NA,,2,Xiaoli Dong,"Sustainability, Ecology","Environmental protection, Life sciences","I am a third year PhD student, working in fluvial landscapes, and am interested in spatial ecology.

As we walk along a stream or a river, we see different species are located in different places. Some sets of species colonize together to form a patch. Some patches have regular patterns while others do not and the geometry of patches may vary widely. Groups of patches are arrayed in space and water flow through and across them. Dissolved nutrients may be taken up or released and organisms can migrate from patch to patch.

Why are ecosystem components located where they are? Is the existing structure optimal for individual within it? How do we even define optimality? How does the spatial structure change over time? Is change directional? If so, what is the mechanism of directionality?

We are puzzled by what we see - the forms of landscapes - and we may contemplate the relationship between form and function. The form-function relationship is a classic concern in physiology and evolutionary biology; yet, the same question, asked at the level of an ecosystem, is stimulating: what is the relationship between landscape heterogeneity and its functioning? To be more specific: how is spatial heterogeneity formed, how does spatial heterogeneity influence ecosystem functioning, and how does ecosystem functioning feedback on spatial structures, if it does so at all? These are the major questions of my dissertation. I do both manipulative experiments in the field and simulation models to answer these questions.

While the amount of work that I can do for my degree is limited, the questions that I propose reach out to more fundamental ideas (1) form-function relationships in complex systems: In physiology, the relationship between form and function is clear: organs are the way they are because they are functional improvements generated by natural selection. However, the form-function relationship gets much more complicated in a complex system like a landscape-ecosystem, a hierarchical level where natural selection does not operate. Rather, self-organization may play an analogous role. This leads to another fundamental idea for ecosystems: (2) Natural selection (NS) vs. self-organization (SO): The definitions of the terms suggest that NS maximizes fitness whereas SO maximize the rate of energy/material flow. As an individual, an organism ""tries"" to maximize its survivorship and reproduction (e.g. to overcome water and nutrient limitation, etc.). As a group of interacting individuals, organisms are patterned into spatial structures. How are these individuals and collective forces reconciled? Does SO help increase fitness? My research endeavors to develop an integrated framework for ecosystems as complex adaptive systems. The broader theoretical foundation is rooted in the intersection of evolutionary theory and ecosystem ecology and in the intersection of community ecology and ecosystem ecology. I look forward to stimulating and challenging discussions on these topics.",Chinese,Female,PhD Student,Arizona State University,USA,2012,Santa Fe,
Flocking in iterated reasoning,,Psychology,Social and behavioural science,3,Seth Frey,Cognitive Science and Informatics,Mathematics and statistics,"Narrowly (dissertation-wise), I'm pushing the experimental side of complex dynamics in game theory. Researchers at SFi suspect that complexity is ubiquitous is complex systems. Economists argue that a newish mechanisms, what-you-think-I-think-you-think, can damp complexity in the real world.

What sort of expertise can you bring to the group?

I've spent most of the past decade killing my heroes---thinking critically about exciting ideas in complex systems. I apply complex systems concepts to social systems using experiments in human collective behavior.

I explore how they do so effectively (or ineffectively) and what implications their actions have for public policy as it happens on the ground. To examine these actors and their impacts, I connect micro-level analyses of these organizations with their strategies on political fields.

For my current project, I examine how social benefit corporations, such as nonprofits that develop affordable housing, navigate urban redevelopment politics and innovate their strategies. These actors understand and respond to changing demographic and increasingly hostile contexts. Due to this empirical interest, I draw from social movements/organizations, organizational behavior, and learning theories.",,Male,PhD Student,Harvard University,USA,2012,Santa Fe,

I am looking forward to meeting everyone in Santa Fe. I am excited to hear about everyone's research and to have the opportunity to work on a project that might be a seed for future collaboration. One short story is that I'm interested in evolution, network science, mathematics, computer science, and language. A longer story is that in light of an internal struggle that I believe has explicitly confronted thinkers, at the least since Kant, my approach to research teeters about the fulcrum between rationalism and empiricism with respect to the order in which each is applied in attempts to cultivate knowledge. My scientific research interests began with synthetic biology and the study of bacterial quorum sensing and broadened from there to include systems biology and the evolution of multicellularity. I am now primarily interested in applying, as yet abstract, tools from mathematics and theoretical computer science to a mereological description of the evolution of hierarchical organization in biological systems that incorporates niche construction with selection in order to derive a more concrete computational model of such. In this context, and being at least a token ontological reductionist, I am also interested in the hierarchical relationship between information representation in molecular and linguistic forms as may be addressed at the level of abstraction of semiotics. Despite my affinity for abstraction, I have attempted to ground myself to ""real"" data via collaborations with developmental biologists in the study of genetic regulation of the cellular differentiation process associated with hematopoiesis, immunologists in the study of synergistic interactions between neutralizing and enhancing antibodies to the anthrax toxin, cell biologists in the study of Holliday junction formation and resolution during meiosis, and cancer biologists in the study of gene expression variability in a mouse model of colon cancer.",,Male,PhD Student,Albert Einstein College of Medicine,USA,2012,Santa Fe,

I study cascades in networks, in both technological systems (such as power grids) and in social ones. A big question for infrastructure systems like power, water, transportation, finance, and so on, is to determine what amount of interdependence balances the benefits of interdependence (such as economies of scale and shared risk) and detriments (such as risk of large, spreading crises). For social systems, I've studied how things go viral, and with increasing ease as we connect in more ways. I'm really excited about work I'm beginning to do on innovation and collaborative problem solving in social networks.

I recently attended two conferences on power grids in Santa Fe, and I'm working on models of blackouts in interdependent power grids. But at the summer school I'm considering doing a project that extends the work I've recently begun on innovation in social networks, hopefully using feedback and ideas from people at the summer school.

We Got the Skills to Pay the Bills - Exploring the Link Between Occupation Diversity and Innovation,,Economics,Social and behavioural science,4,Gareth Haslam,Physics,Physical sciences,"I finished my PhD last June which was focused on developing new electrocatalysts for use in hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCV). FCV are one possible technology that could be very useful in tackling CO2 emissions and air pollution in the transport sector as they convert hydrogen fuel to electricity directly rather than combusting fossil fuels, emitting only water. Whilst they have a number of challenges to overcome, I was looking at how to replace the expensive platinum electrocatalyst which is currently an essential component. This work was carried out at the Dept. of Materials Science at the University of Cambridge, UK. I have previously received a BSc Physics from the University of Durham, UK, and an MPhil in Engineering for Sustainable Development, also at the University of Cambridge. Whilst my background is more experimentally-based, I am keen to learn more about how complexity approaches may be used in materials discovery, at the micro-level, and in promoting technology innovation and alternative energy systems, at the macro-level.

After finishing my PhD, I spent two months at the University of Tokyo at the Dept. of Complexity Science, with the 2011 JSPS Summer Program (known as EAPSI in the US). I am now working as a postdoc at the United Nations University - Institute of Advanced Studies in Yokohama, Japan where I am trying to bring a technical perspective to science and innovation policy. I have done some preliminary research looking at how patent and publication data can be used as an indicator for fuel cell innovation and would like to expand that to look at social interactions between scientists, companies, institutes etc. Another interesting area might involve agent-based modelling to see the effect of different policies on improving the rate of technical progress/innovation. I am hoping that some of the ideas and experiences at the Santa Fe CSSS will provide new jumping-off points for further research once this position finishes in September 2012.

I'm currently a postdoc fellow at the Paleontological Institute and Museum of the Univ. of Zurich, Switzerland (PIMUZ).

My main interest is in the coupled histories of Earth and life on various spatial and time scales. My recent research experience includes the integrative use of paleontological, geochemical and sedimentological data in order to study the mechanisms that led to the greatest mass extinction of the Phanerozoic at the Permo-Triassic boundary (about 250 Ma).

During my PhD in paleontology I became an expert on conodonts, which were eel-shaped, marine animals. Their tooth-like phosphatic elements represent the earliest expression of a mineralized skeleton among vertebrates. These conodont elements are important index fossils from the Cambrian to the end of the Triassic. As such, not only they provide an interesting tool for evolutionary studies, but they also enable to construct timescales against which geological and biological events can be calibrated. Moreover, their chemical composition has remained relatively stable and hence they record past changes in the temperature and composition of oceans.

Some of my last results include a 3d reconstruction of their oro-pharyngeal apparatus at work (movie). In the near future I plan to use functional analysis of these ‘teeth’ to infer the potential location of different conodont taxa within past food webs and to study changes of these food webs’ topology in relation with evolutionary events (innovations, radiations, crisis). Because the morphology of these ‘teeth’ obviously do not reflect only functional purposes but also important developmental aspects (which are potentially common to extant vertebrates), another project that I’m currently preparing deals with the morphogenesis of these tooth-like elements.

During the last years I have devoted most of my efforts to the production and analysis of empirical data. In the near future I plan to focus on the development of data-driven theoretical models. In most of these projects, I have to deal with complex systems. Though my training as a physicist included some of the required tools, I feel that I might need an update on some of the topics addressed during the CSSS. My main motivation for attending (and actively participating in ;) ) the CSSS is to have the chance to meet the experts on these topics and hence get a current overview over potentials and limitations of complex systems research. It would also give me the opportunity to assess the strengths and weaknesses of my educational cursus, and to reflect on my current research by stepping back and looking at new, wider horizons. I also expect that the stimulating discussions with you guys will lead to new ideas for my research and possibly to new collaborations.",,Male,PostDoc,University of Zurich,Switzerland,2012,Santa Fe,

I think the following blurb pretty well summarizes my current interests and goals. I'm brewing up some ideas for neural network models as a project while at the SFI summer school.

""My research crosses the boundaries of evolutionary biology, cognitive science, complexity theory, and philosophy. Inspired by neural network models of learning, I am studying how sets of genes evolve together as integrated systems. In the course of this research, I have been struck by similarities between evolutionary processes and mechanisms of learning displayed by brains. I am exploring these similarities further in pursuit of a modern, network-based conception of evolutionary genetics, which I will explicate in my forthcoming book, The Genetic Mind: Genes as Learning Networks.""

"The Robustness, Stability and Persistence of Niche-Structured Food Webs",,Network Analysis,"Computing, Life Sciences",4,Miguel Lurgi,Computer Science,Computing,"My main research interests are focused on: (i) the understanding of the mechanisms behind the emergence of structure in ecological networks of different kinds, primarily food webs, plant-pollinator and host-symbiont networks; (ii) the study of the assembly and disassembly dynamics of ecological networks, particularly how relevant is evolution and the emergence of novelty for these processes; and (iii) the stability of this kind of networks, how to measure it and how this stability is related to the network structure and dynamics. All this in the context of environmental change and how different components of this change (e.g. climate change, habitat loss, species invasions) affect the structure of the interactions network and ultimately the dynamics of the system and the species populations, and the ecosystem functioning.

From a theoretical perspective I tackle these problems through an individual (agent) based, spatially explicit simulation approach. Because evolutionary change occurs at the level of the individual, this scale is relevant for the kind of problems mentioned above; also, interactions in real ecosystem ultimately happen at the individual level and the spatial scale is important when looking at the actual occurrence of these interactions.

I have also applied complex networks techniques for the analysis of empirically obtained interaction networks to look at the changes of their structure due to climate change.

Expertise
As a computer scientist I have worked mainly in the development of multi-agent based systems and have also some experience in other computational techniques such as genetic algorithms and neural networks. My most recent research in the area of AI was the development of an ecologically inspired technique for the engineering of intelligent agent based systems.

The science of cities incorporates a variety of frameworks—what Herbert Simon calls the ‘science of the artificial’—such as artificial life, agent based design, systems dynamics, information theory and data mining. With over half the world’s population living in cities and millions more moving to them every year, an understanding of growth and decay patterns in cities as organism-like systems within a broader context is intimately connected with meta-level processes such as global warming and developing long term sustainable and regenerative approaches to design.

John is primarily interested is in the rationalization of city planning and the emerging field of the science of cities, the goal being to apply theory and methods from complex systems science to the research, analysis and design of urban environments. Cities are simultaneously the physical manifestation of buildings and infrastructure or hardware as well as the software and wetware of socio-economic systems and biological-ecological systems. Fractal cartography, cellular automata simulation, genetic algorithms and statistical physics are some of the theoretical components underlying a scientific framework of cities, utilizing technology and information. The science of cities incorporates a variety of frameworks—what Herbert Simon calls the ‘science of the artificial’—such as artificial life, agent based design, systems dynamics, information theory and data mining. With over half the world’s population living in cities and millions more moving to them every year, an understanding of growth and decay patterns in cities as organism-like systems within a broader context is intimately connected with meta-level processes such as global warming and developing long term sustainable and regenerative approaches to design.

I work on computational and mathematical models of the pervasive phenomenon of language change. While signalling systems of varying complexity can be found in all living organisms, human language is unique in that large sets of arbitrary conventions are constantly being replaced by other arbitrary conventions at a pretty fast pace, and for no apparent reason. While the emergence of new conventions that help organisms adapt to their environment is unsurprising, what the advantage of replacing one perfectly working arbitrary signal with another one is is less clear, so I want to find out how exactly this process might work and why it's there in the first place!

Matrix Matters,,Mathematics,Mathematics and statistics,4,Kristen Honey,Ecology,Life sciences,"I am a broadly trained marine population and community ecologist⎯interested in understanding the interplay of species’ traits, environmental variability, and population and community dynamics⎯with unique experience in and a passion for synthesizing science and applying it to real-world policy and management challenges. I completed my Stanford University PhD in September 2012 with a dissertation entitled, “Aligning Complex, Adaptive Systems Theory and Data-Limited Assessment Strategies for Improved Fisheries Management.” During the completion of my Stanford PhD and the work that I performed during this period, I focused upon integrative fisheries management to bridge the gaps between regulators, scientists, and fishermen. This involved explicit consideration of optimal sampling designs and data collection protocols for long-term monitoring and evaluation of California’s network of marine protected areas. For years, I hoped to attend the Santa Fe Institute’s Complex Systems Summer School (CSSS) but was previously committed with PhD fieldwork and SCUBA diving to count fish each summer—until now! Today, I work for a private firm, Integrated Statistics, but my office is at NOAA headquarters in Silver Spring, MD. I work on NOAA’s Large Marine Ecosystems program, which is complex, adaptive systems and adaptive management in action!

As further motivation and enthusiasm for CSSS 2013, I am keenly interested in disease ecology. My interest stems from my own Lyme disease misdiagnosis and the ineffectiveness of conventional medical treatments. To fully heal myself and recover, I resorted to collaborating with other researchers and medical doctors to pioneer a novel treatment protocol using experimental nano-mineral treatments to facilitate antibiotic delivery across the blood-brain barrier, combat intracellular infection, and dissolve biofilms. It involves intravenous treatment with nano-silver, nano-gold, and trace minerals (oligotherapy), energetically treated by a plasma arc to increase resonance potential and efficacy. No doubt, my willingness to use my own body as a guinea pig was a risk—but a calculated risk that ultimately paid off by returning my health to 100% capacity. My decision to take such a personal risk was deeply rooted in basic science and empirical data, combined with my knowledge of the human body as its own ecosystem with resilience, hysteresis, and multi-system dynamics with synergistic properties. Hence, my training in complex, adaptive systems indirectly helped return me to life.

My experience with infectious disease science is distinct from my marine ecosystem expertise but both our human bodies and the oceans are complex, adaptive systems with non-linear dynamics and multiple stable states.

Align with my broad research area, I am interested in machine learning, data mining, dynamical system theory, artificial intelligence, computational learning theory, physics of disordered systems, complex networks and related fields.

Currently, my focus is on reservoir computing, which is a new paradigm in neural networks and has shown great performance in non-linear and chaotic signal processing. In contrast to traditional neural networks, in which the system is fine tuned using a learning algorithm to solve a particular task, in reservoir computing a recurrent neural network is initialized and fixed with no further fine tuning. The signal is given to the network and a linear readout layer performs a linear combination of the states to produce the target output. The weights of the linear combination is calculated using linear regression which can be performed in closed form efficiently. My goal is to understand this paradigm better and study what kinds of problems they can and they cannot solve and how the paradigm can be applied to unconventional computing substrates such as nanoscale self-assembled electronics or DNA molecules.

My most recent work on reservoir computing is the direct estimation of error in task solving based on the structure of the dynamical system and statics of the input and output. The approach is currently limited to linear systems but I'm hoping to extend it to nonlinear systems and systems with finite dynamic range.

She wishes to understand biological network dynamics and the roles that observable pathophysiology and periodic structures play in these dynamics. If physiological symptoms such as increased temperature or heart rate result from altered network structure, function, and dynamics (or vice versa), there is therapeutic potential in manipulation of these networks. Interactions of cellular, genetic, and metabolic networks with observable physiology may be hierarchical and should cross multiple scales.

Align with my broad research area, I am interested in machine learning, data mining, dynamical system theory, artificial intelligence, computational learning theory, physics of disordered systems, complex networks and related fields.

Currently, my focus is on reservoir computing, which is a new paradigm in neural networks and has shown great performance in non-linear and chaotic signal processing. In contrast to traditional neural networks, in which the system is fine tuned using a learning algorithm to solve a particular task, in reservoir computing a recurrent neural network is initialized and fixed with no further fine tuning. The signal is given to the network and a linear readout layer performs a linear combination of the states to produce the target output. The weights of the linear combination is calculated using linear regression which can be performed in closed form efficiently. My goal is to understand this paradigm better and study what kinds of problems they can and they cannot solve and how the paradigm can be applied to unconventional computing substrates such as nanoscale self-assembled electronics or DNA molecules.

My most recent work on reservoir computing is the direct estimation of error in task solving based on the structure of the dynamical system and statics of the input and output. The approach is currently limited to linear systems but I'm hoping to extend it to nonlinear systems and systems with finite dynamic range.

Emergence of Consciousness,,Psychology,Humanities,20,Renske Vroomans,Biology,Life sciences,"Hi, I am Renske, a PhD student at Utrecht University. I work in the Theoretical Biology group on modelling expression patterns in embryonic tissue, which are created by gene regulatory networks. In particular, I aim to investigate the interaction between the formation of a segmented pattern (stripes), and tissue shape changes caused by the movement of cells. I enjoy working with (computational) models, in part because they help me think clearly about what I do and do not know, and what the consequences of certain assumptions are. But the magic really begins when theory and experiment can be combined of course! I can work with Python, C and C++ (ish) and know quite a bit about modeling cells in space (Cellular Potts Model, anyone?)",,Female,PhD Student,Utrecht University,Netherlands,2014,Santa Fe,

I'm Research Fellow at the University of Leeds (UK), working across the disciplines of engineering, economics and social science. My background is interdisciplinary: my PhD was in Physical Chemistry but I’ve also worked in the public sector with businesses. My research interests centre on energy systems and their transformation in order to achieve affordable low-carbon energy. I work with local government organisations in the UK and, more widely, am also interested in how complexity tools can be applied to energy challenges and translated into policy action.

At the CSSS I hope to gain a deeper understanding of the range of tools that can be used to investigate complex systems, meet people with different perspectives, and come away with new ideas for my research.",,Female,PostDoc,University of Leeds,UK,2014,Santa Fe,

I was born in Galicia, in the Northwest of Spain and lived there until the end of the second year of my Economics degree, spending most of my free time in a little village with four houses. After that I moved to Glasgow to finish my Bachelors, then to London for the masters, and finally to Florence. My research focuses in the role of information inequality and peer effects on different social systems and markets. I am currently studying the triggering of mass protests in authoritarian regimes, the significance of peer effects for Pakistan civil servants’ productivity, the effect of graph temperature and entropy on consensus time in regular networks, the role of heterogeneous expectations about future prices across Spanish households during the last housing bubble, and the support for increasing regional autonomy and independence in Western Europe.
