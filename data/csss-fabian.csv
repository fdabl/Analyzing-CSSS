The seismic reliability of the substations (nodes) was evaluated under the impact of earthquake. Power flow (load flow) analysis was conducted on the hypothetical power network. The most vulnerable (critical) edges and nodes were evaluated with complex network theory.

The title of my dissertation was ""Understanding the interplay of structure and dynamics in neuronal networks"", and much of my research has focused on questions in the field of neuroscience. Networks are very important in this field as the brain is a prime example of a very complicated network. Important features of neuronal networks are that the nodes (neurons) are dynamic due to the firing of action potentials, and the edges (synapses) are constantly evolving. The main part of my dissertation focused on a new clustering algorithm that utilizes these neuronal dynamics to detect groupings of neurons with similar firing patterns. I think that studying networks with dynamic nodes will become increasingly important as we try to apply network theory to more types of networks. Since neuronal networks can be viewed as time series of discrete events, I'd like to extend this line of thinking to types of networks outside of neuroscience, and I'm hoping that this workshop will be a good place to do so. In addition to the algorithm development and subsequent data analysis, much of my time in graduate school was spent doing experimental work growing dissociated hippocampal cultures and studying how the underlying structure of these networks influences their dynamics. I also spent some time doing computational modeling of epilepsy where I studied two coupled networks of neurons and looked at resonance and driving relationships between the networks as one network transitioned into seizure dynamics. Although this was my first project as a graduate student, my new postdoctoral position will also be in the field of epilepsy research. Network analysis is becoming increasingly important in epilepsy to study the initiation and propagation of seizures, so I'm quite excited to work in this area.

The Electricity Grid as a case-study on the Interface of Engineering Systems and Human Behavior,,,Engineering and engineering trades,4,Alexis Dinno,Epidemiologist,Health,"Hello!
 
 My name is Alexis, but friends call me Lexy-Lou (or Lex, or&#133;), and I am a social epidemiologist and social ecologist. I have just defended my dissertation at Harvard School of Public Health where I majored in quantitative methods (emphasis on statistical modeling: multilevel models, spatial models, causal models, etc.) in the department of Health and Social Behavior (now Society, Health and Human Development). The third chapter of my dissertation entails a loop analysis of residential depressive experience, urban neighborhood property abandonment and urban greenspace programs.
 
 My interests in complex systems analysis are diverse:
 
  I have an abiding interest in the ontological and ideological commitments implicit in the choice of a specific analytic method. What kinds of inquiry are mobilized by systems analyses? How do they differ from (non-systems) alternatives?
 
  I have recently published an implementation of Richard Levins' qualitative loop analysis (Loop Analyst) for R on CRAN with some recent extensions. However, I am not a computer scientist, and the computationally intensive nature of the method demands that I produce more efficient code for the current implementation as well as for future extensions. Therefore I hope to sharpen my mathematical and computing skills.
 
  I have found qualitative loop analysis of system behavior to be a rewarding and robust analytic method. However, this has only been my introduction to systems approaches, and I would like both to extend my analytic repertoire, as well as to situate my ""toolkit"" within a wider domain of systems methods.

Ecological modeling of arrow bamboo,"Using two models (analysis of altitude-abundance patterns and an agent-based model) we demonstrate that global warming is a possible explanation of the declines of arrow bamboos in Mount Shennongjia, west-central China. Under two different scenarios (Temperature increments 1.5° C and 6 °C) both models predict upward shifts of bamboo populations. For the first scenario, the agent-based model also predicts serious reductions of the population of bamboo. For the second scenario the first model predicts serious declines (>%50) whereas extinction of the bamboo are predicted under the second model. Differences between the predicted bamboo populations and the models are due to the agent-based model’s inclusion of bamboo life history traits and competition with other plant species.

Upon returning from China, I will begin a postdoc with the University of Western Ontario's Rotman Institute of Science and Values. My work is in two main areas: social/political philosophy, and the philosophy of science. My advisor at Penn was Cristina Bicchieri.

My dissertation was in political philosophy: in particular, I developed a new account of social contract theory that focused on how social contracts should function in diverse societies. This involved developing an account of perspectives (by which I mean a scheme of categorization and a search procedure), a novel moral standpoint - ""The View from Everywhere"", a bargaining approach that allows the participants to not have to agree over what they are bargaining over, and an account of toleration. This is the beginning of a larger project on diversity in social systems.

Smaller projects that I am also working in also revolve around issues with diversity. I'm in the midst of finishing a paper that got started by my CSSS work in '06 - a model of the Schelling Segregation Dynamic in which agents who want to be in the minority end up segregated anyway. I have also begun planning a follow-up paper on this topic that will (hopefully) show that if agents pay attention to different properties, there are more stable integrated states. The thought is that if some find race salient, while others find religion important, and still others find taste in music most salient, then there will be more of a chance that the macro view of the population will be integrated.

I also have been working on social norms. A paper I'm working on completing right now looks at the conditions under which multiple norms can be a stable state of an evolutionary game. In particular, what learning rules support such a stable state, and whether network structure of the population influences the equilibrium state.

In the philosophy of science, I have methodological interests, looking at the epistemic justifications of the tools of complex systems analysis. However, I am most interested in the social structure of science, particularly how incentive systems and methods of communication shape the output of science. I've coauthored a couple papers on this subject, developing an ""epistemic landscapes"" model of scientific sub-fields. Scientist-agents act as hill climbers on an unknown landscape. What I investigate is what methods of incorporating information about the attempts of other scientists is most conducive to maximizing social output. This project has been working with a model of implicit networks, but the next model iteration, which I hope will be able to describe longer timescales, will be moving to a dynamic explicit network structure.

At the moment, my all research attempts is devoted to find a satisfactory answer to the main question, that is how agents with an interconnection pattern that provides them the local information about the environment can decide on their actions so to improve the global goal, or in competitive agents that have their self local goals how they can decide on their interactions so the global constraints respected. In brief, my main major in research on complex systems comes from control theoretic contexts. I am looking forward to see you all friends and to learn a lot with you in this summer.

Modeling the farming society: based on their climate perception and possibility of water trading during scarcity,"The emergence of cooperation in a virtual farming society is modeled here.

Opinion spreading and consensus formation on complex networks,"We study a model of opinion spreading and consensus formation in a population on complex networks. Given a static network structure, the individuals can diffuse on it when two neighboring individuals’ opinions are beyond the “bounded confidence” ε.

At each time step, each individual can exchange their opinions with their neighbors if the difference of their opinions is smaller than ε; otherwise, one can move to an vacancy location if permitted. The distribution of opinions over the population evolves towards either a consensus that all individuals share the same opinion or polarization and fragmentation state.

Effects of Nutrient Limitation on the Dynamics of an Estuarine Food Web,"Estuaries are defined by their shifting salinity and nutrients, yet food web models rarely incorporate these impacts on producers. This study combined a box model of abiotic conditions with a food web model of trophic levels to study how nutrient limitation affects Chesapeake Bay biota. Using ac- tual data, the model tested the hypothesis that nutrient limitation affects lower trophic levels more than higher ones. Without nutrient limitation, the entire food web persisted with higher abundances of species directly feed- ing on trophic level one. Nutrient limitation reduced phytoplankton GPP, but those consumers not directly feeding on phytoplankton were hurt most by reduced GPP, counter to predictions. Additionally, the model predicts that reductions in silica suppress diatom populations, which again affects indirectly-linked species most strongly. The generally greater effects of nu- trient limitation, and corresponding GPP suppression, on species indirectly linked to phytoplankton may be due to a magnification of trophic transfer inefficiency along food chains. However, as the silica example shows, limita- tion of specific nutrients will have an asymmetric affect on the Chesapeake Bay food web because those species trophically linked to species dependent on the nutrient will be affected more than species not linked to affected pro- ducers.

As opposed to the common synchronous modeling, we assign rates to the different molecular processes involved in gene regulation and investigate the effects of a stochastic updating mechanism in a simple model of the yeast cell cycle. We model the transitions between different states of the Boolean network as independent Poisson processes. Two different updating schemes are proposed and investigated using both a master equation approach and Monte Carlo simulation.
We find that introducing biologically inspired rates increases the probability of the system to reach the biological G1 stationary state. We investigate which rate parameters most strongly affect the probability of reaching this state and discuss the underlying mechanisms.","Biology, Genetics",Life sciences; Mathematics and statistics,4,Christoph Neugebauer,Chemistry,Physical sciences,"I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Chemistry of the University of Cambridge, UK.

Exploring the Delay Embedding of an Electroencephalogram Signal,"One can hardly argue against the observation that the brain is a nonlinear system. And yet, most traditional methods of analyzing brain activity, whether recorded by electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or otherwise have tended to stick with linear analysis tools. Much of the reason for this derives from the fact that no one has yet developed a generalized scheme for nonlinear analysis. In this study we adopt a technique for time series analysis known as delay embedding ?. We apply this to a series of EEG scalp recordings. Delay embedding promises to reconstruct the hidden dynamics of a system by revealing a multi-dimensional space topologically equivalent to the internal phase space. However, this promise depends upon a relatively noise-free signal ?. Unfortunately, noise frequently dominates EEG signals recorded from the scalp. In this study, we applied delay embedding to sev- eral EEG signals. The results looked promising at first, but after further analysis, we found that they appear more ambiguous than we originally hoped necessitating further research.","Nonlinear Dynamics, Neuroscience",Life sciences,1,Alessandro Gagliardi,Neuroscience,Social and behavioural sciences,"Alessandro is a graduate student in the Integrative Neuroscience Program and works in the Rutgers University Mind Brain Analysis (RUMBA) Lab under Stephen Hanson.

The Dynamics and Semantics of Collaborative Tagging,"The debate within the Web community over the optimal means by which to organize information often pits formalized classifications (such as the Semantic Web) against distributed collaborative tagging systems. A number of questions remain unanswered, however, regarding the nature of collaborative tag- ging systems including the dynamics of such systems and whether coherent clas- sification schemes can emerge from the user community. Currently millions of users are using collaborative tagging without centrally organizing principles for tagging behavior, which marks a system exhibiting features considered to be in- dicative of a complex system. If this is the case, it remains to be seem whether user behavior over time leads to emergent classification schemes that could be formalized by the Semantic Web.
This paper uses data from “popular” and newly tagged sites on the social book- marking site del.icio.us to examine the dynamics of such collaborative tagging systems, in particular whether the distribution of tag frequencies stabilizes, indi- cating a degree of cohesion or consensus among users about the optimal tags to describe particular sites.

An Agent Based Model of Crisis-Driven Migration,"The literature on ethnic migration suggests that natural disasters, armed conflict, economics and cultural networks are key drivers of migration. The dearth of geo- referenced ethnic data, however, limits the value of econometric analysis. We build an agent-based model to simulate crisis-driven migration. Agents within a multi-ethnic population monitor their spatial environments to formulate perceptions of the risk of being persecuted. The expected utility of staying within a given neighborhood is inversely related to the perceived probability of persecution. Cultural networks temper an agent's security calculus, with strong social ties dampening the human security dilemma. Agents express preferences regarding the different ethnic groups in their spatial environment and social network.

He is a mechanical engineer and has always been interested in operation of human brain and the use of brain theory principles in human made intelligence systems. So in his graduate studies he set out on a journey to build a brain for an energy distribution system. The brain’s primary role would be to predict short term energy consumption of its clients from past experience and estimate the risk of prediction error. Based on this the system would determine its economically optimal operation. That would assure the system operating costs would be as low as possible while all the clients energy needs would be satisfied. After a successful birth of the first prediction brain an entrepreneurial bug bit him so he set out to use the prediction brains commercially in several district energy distribution systems.

The developed brains were using simulated neural networks and genetic algorithms to solve their tasks. But Marko still was not satisfied with the intelligence capabilities his brains were having. So now he is starting to examine the use of more sophisticated brain theory principles to autonomously solve given problems. He is especially interested in using Jeff Hawkins’ memory-prediction framework of the brain (Hierarchical Temporal Memory) for intelligent extraction of information from past experience. To effectively use this framework he needs to have more knowledge in the fields of neuroscience, dynamics of complex systems, etc. Armed with this knowledge maybe some day he will be able to answer his favorite problem of how to develop an intelligent system that autonomously extracts and understands the information available on the internet.

Whenever Marko is tired of playing with his artificial intelligence buddies he loves to interact and communicate with other people. In his free time he also practices some weird sport of golf, runs a lot and tries to devote as much time as possible to his princess.

Now he is setting out on a journey half across the world to a beautiful small town of Santa Fe to conquer new knowledge, form new friendships and have an unforgettable experience.

An agent-based model of forest use with social learning,"We present an agent based model for deforestation under social learning. We assume a forest is composed of a number of land parcels. Each parcel is in either a forested or a deforested state, and the state transition is described via a two-state Markov chain. Landowners decide whether or not to cut trees based on the relative expected utility of forested and deforested parcels. The expected utility is altered by information input about actual utility, in particular the average experience in a society. We study the global landscape dynamics that result from individual decisions. We observed stationary-forested, stationary-deforested, and cyclic-forested landscapes that are induced by collective deforestation. We investigated feedback from global landscape dynamics to individual decision. We found that if the value of forested land increased with the decline of forest density, collective deforestation was more likely to occur. Extinction of forest ecosystems was predicted if the forest recovery rate was diminished by an intensive deforestation. We discuss the implications for forest policy and management.",Ecology,"Agriculture, forestry and fishery",1,Akiko Satake,Ecology,Life sciences,"I am a postdoc in Evolutionary Ecology at Princeton University.

Diversifying to cope with Environmental Change,"This paper aims to find informative proxies of vulnerability and adaptive capacity by using synergies between information theory and vulnerability science. In particular this paper looks at diversification as a key characteristic of adaptive capacity and means of coping with an uncertain environment.

Adaptive capacity is expressed as a function of the varying environmental conditions a system or actor is subjected to and the actions a system or actor can take. By associating maximum long-term growth rates with a system that is optimally adapted to its environment this paper builds a bridge between information theoretical metrics and adaptive capacity. For the explored examples, the adaptive capacity of an actor that diversifies is found to be the relative entropy between the actual distribution of the environment and a distribution for which the actor’s diversification level would be optimal.",Ecology,Social and behavioural sciences,2,Saskia Werners,,,"Increasing evidence of global change creates an environment of great uncertainty. A basic challenge of water management is finding ways to cope with changing conditions and an increasingly uncertain natural disturbances regime. In research areas other than water management, diversification has been shown successful in increasing adaptive capacity, learning and innovation. However the relationship between diversity and the ability to cope with uncertain stresses has been a neglected research topic in river basin management. For long river basin management has focussed on selecting the most cost effective measure to cope with a specific quantified stress. The underlying structure of how diverse water system services and their users interact with the full range of the natural disturbances regime has been addressed rarely. The relationship of diversification and adaptive capacity remains largely unexplored.

The objective of my research is to evaluate how diversification of water system services and their use can support adaptive capacity in managed river basins at different scales in time and space.

Games on Evolving Networks,"Thispaperexploresthecoevolutionofnetworkformationandcooperativebehaviour.Ithas previously been shown that the structure of a community (for example, as formed by social relationships) can have a substantial impact on the evolution of cooperative behaviour. We hypothesize that the nature of the game played on such a network can alter the way that individuals make and break social connections, therefore leading to a feedback loop between the network structure and the behaviour in the game. We explore the dynamics of this process in a model where individuals form connections with others based on simple genetically encoded rules, and play one of a variety of two-player games with their connections. In order to explore the effects of different payoff structures in these games, simulations over a wide range of parameter space have been pursued, producing games including the Prisoner’s Dilemma, the Stag Hunt, and Hawk-Dove. By comparing to traditional game-theoretic models, we show that allowing the network structure to evolve prevents defectors from completely taking over the population, and also broadens the circumstances under which cooperation can fix. A first analysis of the properties of the networks created in these evolving populations suggests a mechanism for these results: when defectors are common, networks are created which tend to retard the effects of selection and encourage drift, while when cooperators are common, the networks formed tend to enhance selection and drive the population more quickly to the fully cooperative outcome.","Game Theory, Computer Sciencs",Social and behavioural sciences,5,Juan Calderon,,,"Doing some research on the propagation of information through social networks, where information is analogous to a virus spreading through the social network.
I´m very interested on the evolution of social and human behaviour, focusing mainly on altruism and how cooperation among individuals evolves. I'm working on an agent-based model to study the evolution of strong reciprocity and the effect that plasticity on the agents has on the evolutionary process.

Using experimental microcosms (the soil mite Sancassania berlesei) and simulation models, I am investigating how ecological and evolutionary processes, and their interaction, are affected by environmental change and spatial structuring. In particular my studies focus on:

•How the scale and type of spatial patterning in the environment interacts with individual, population and intra-specific processes to shape population structure.

•The impact of population structure on ecological and evolutionary processes that determine responses to perturbation and environmental change.

•How scale differences between processes may impact these responses to change.

•The power of dispersal in assorting population variation and its impact on projecting responses to a period of environmental change. ",,Male,PhD,University of Leeds,UK,2006,Santa Fe,
