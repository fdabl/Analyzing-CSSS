An agent-based model of forest use with social learning,"We present an agent based model for deforestation under social learning. We assume a forest is composed of a number of land parcels. Each parcel is in either a forested or a deforested state, and the state transition is described via a two-state Markov chain. Landowners decide whether or not to cut trees based on the relative expected utility of forested and deforested parcels. The expected utility is altered by information input about actual utility, in particular the average experience in a society. We study the global landscape dynamics that result from individual decisions. We observed stationary-forested, stationary-deforested, and cyclic-forested landscapes that are induced by collective deforestation. We investigated feedback from global landscape dynamics to individual decision. We found that if the value of forested land increased with the decline of forest density, collective deforestation was more likely to occur. Extinction of forest ecosystems was predicted if the forest recovery rate was diminished by an intensive deforestation. We discuss the implications for forest policy and management.",Ecology,Agriculture and forestry and fishery,1,Akiko Satake,Ecology,Life sciences,"I am a postdoc in Evolutionary Ecology at Princeton University. I recieved my PhD at Kyushu University in Japan in 2002. My research interest is in developing theoretical framework to explore sustainable resource management. My current research focuses on how decisions of individual landowners influence landscape patterns. By developing an agent-based model for a coupled human and ecological system, we are addressing the following questions: (1) which social and ecological conditions favor forested or deforested landscapes, (2) what types of property regimes (individual, group, or government) are appropriate for effective management of forest ecosystems, and (3) how does the social structure of groups influence the success of forest management?",,Male,PostDoc,Princeton University,United States,Top 50,2006,Santa Fe,Fabian,

An Optimization Algorithm Based on the Small-World Phenomenon,"We propose an optimization algorithm, called the small-world algorithm (SWA), based on searching mechanisms in social networks. The SWA emphasizes local rather than global search to find the solutions for optimization problems. We investigate two encoding strategies, binary encoding and decimal encoding, in the SWA and test them by function optimization and 0- 1 multidimensional knapsack problems. Simulation studies show that compared with the corresponding genetic algorithm (GA) the SWA is capable of preserving diversity in the set of candidate solutions, avoiding premature of the population, overcoming the “GA deceptive problem” and it converges faster. These properties suggest that the SWA is a useful method for solving complicated optimization problems.","Computer Science, Sociology",Computing;Mathematics and statistics,3,Jie Shao,Zoology,Life sciences,"I am a second-year PhD student in Zoology at the University of Oklahoma.

The Electricity Grid as a case-study on the Interface of Engineering Systems and Human Behavior,,,Engineering and engineering trades,4,Alexis Dinno,Epidemiologist,Health,"Hello!
 
 My name is Alexis, but friends call me Lexy-Lou (or Lex, or&#133;), and I am a social epidemiologist and social ecologist. I have just defended my dissertation at Harvard School of Public Health where I majored in quantitative methods (emphasis on statistical modeling: multilevel models, spatial models, causal models, etc.) in the department of Health and Social Behavior (now Society, Health and Human Development). The third chapter of my dissertation entails a loop analysis of residential depressive experience, urban neighborhood property abandonment and urban greenspace programs.
 
 My interests in complex systems analysis are diverse:
 
  I have an abiding interest in the ontological and ideological commitments implicit in the choice of a specific analytic method. What kinds of inquiry are mobilized by systems analyses? How do they differ from (non-systems) alternatives?
 
  I have recently published an implementation of Richard Levins' qualitative loop analysis (Loop Analyst) for R on CRAN with some recent extensions. However, I am not a computer scientist, and the computationally intensive nature of the method demands that I produce more efficient code for the current implementation as well as for future extensions. Therefore I hope to sharpen my mathematical and computing skills.
 
  I have found qualitative loop analysis of system behavior to be a rewarding and robust analytic method.

Seismic Analysis of Power Systems Performance,"Civil infrastructure systems, including power systems, water delivery systems and communication systems, etc. are the essential urban elements and are also highly vulnerable to natural and man-made disasters such as earthquakes and terrorist attacks. Power system is especially crucial to emergency response, recovery, and post-disaster reconstruction. Damaged power systems could result in severe socio-economic consequences. Using the data from the power utilities including 2706 buses and more than 3400 branches, we studied the system reliability and the performance of the power system under both a given scenario earthquake and a hypothetical terrorist attack. The seismic reliability of the substations (nodes) was evaluated under the impact of earthquake. Power flow (load flow) analysis was conducted on the hypothetical power network. The most vulnerable (critical) edges and nodes were evaluated with complex network theory. These results can be used to estimate cascading failure and direct and indirect economic loss induced by the damaged power system.

"Complexity, Identity & Delegation","What makes something complex? The short answer is that it contains many different parts, whose aggregate behavior is not easy to formally describe. The key contributions to complexity lie behind the words many, different, aggregate and easy. For engineers & managers, making the effort to at least approximate a formal specification is fundamental to analysis and management; doing so with complexity has been a challenge. Determining the proper balance between engineering or management effort and the resulting increase in efficiency and effectiveness can be a matter of system and managerial survival because complex interactions, such as those found in everything from agriculture to electric grids and increasingly information technology, often result in unexpected and overwhelming changes in operating conditions.",Philosophy,Humanities,1,Linsey O'Brien,,,,,Female,Industry,MITRE Corporation,United States,Not University,2006,Santa Fe,Fabian,

Exploring the Delay Embedding of an Electroencephalogram Signal,"One can hardly argue against the observation that the brain is a nonlinear system. And yet, most traditional methods of analyzing brain activity, whether recorded by electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or otherwise have tended to stick with linear analysis tools. Much of the reason for this derives from the fact that no one has yet developed a generalized scheme for nonlinear analysis. In this study we adopt a technique for time series analysis known as delay embedding ?. We apply this to a series of EEG scalp recordings. Delay embedding promises to reconstruct the hidden dynamics of a system by revealing a multi-dimensional space topologically equivalent to the internal phase space. However, this promise depends upon a relatively noise-free signal ?. Unfortunately, noise frequently dominates EEG signals recorded from the scalp. In this study, we applied delay embedding to sev- eral EEG signals. The results looked promising at first, but after further analysis, we found that they appear more ambiguous than we originally hoped necessitating further research.","Nonlinear Dynamics, Neuroscience",Life sciences,1,Alessandro Gagliardi,Neuroscience,Social and behavioural science,"Alessandro is a graduate student in the Integrative Neuroscience Program and works in the Rutgers University Mind Brain Analysis (RUMBA) Lab under Stephen Hanson.

Effects of Nutrient Limitation on the Dynamics of an Estuarine Food Web,"Estuaries are defined by their shifting salinity and nutrients, yet food web models rarely incorporate these impacts on producers. This study combined a box model of abiotic conditions with a food web model of trophic levels to study how nutrient limitation affects Chesapeake Bay biota.

Without nutrient limitation, the entire food web persisted with higher abundances of species directly feed- ing on trophic level one. Nutrient limitation reduced phytoplankton GPP, but those consumers not directly feeding on phytoplankton were hurt most by reduced GPP, counter to predictions. Additionally, the model predicts that reductions in silica suppress diatom populations, which again affects indirectly-linked species most strongly. The generally greater effects of nu- trient limitation, and corresponding GPP suppression, on species indirectly linked to phytoplankton may be due to a magnification of trophic transfer inefficiency along food chains. However, as the silica example shows, limita- tion of specific nutrients will have an asymmetric affect on the Chesapeake Bay food web because those species trophically linked to species dependent on the nutrient will be affected more than species not linked to affected pro- ducers.

Activity-dependent Growth and Self-Organization in a Neural Network Model,"Civil infrastructure systems, including power systems, water delivery systems and communication systems, etc. are the essential urban elements and are also highly vulnerable to natural and man-made disasters such as earthquakes and terrorist attacks. Power system is especially crucial to emergency response, recovery, and post-disaster reconstruction. Damaged power systems could result in severe socio-economic consequences. Using the data from the power utilities including 2706 buses and more than 3400 branches, we studied the system reliability and the performance of the power system under both a given scenario earthquake and a hypothetical terrorist attack. The seismic reliability of the substations (nodes) was evaluated under the impact of earthquake. Power flow (load flow) analysis was conducted on the hypothetical power network. The most vulnerable (critical) edges and nodes were evaluated with complex network theory. These results can be used to estimate cascading failure and direct and indirect economic loss induced by the damaged power system. The results could also be useful for local planning department and power industries to evaluate the most vulnerable nodes/edges of the power system and improve their seismic performance under economic constrains.",,Mathematics and statistics,4,Alred Kaye,Computational Neuroscience,Social and behavioural science,"I am an MD/PhD student (starting in August) at the University of California, San Diego.

Predicting Time Series of Complex System,"Scientists have a predilection for finding patterns and establishing relationships in the world around them. One way of doing this is simply by taking mea- surements of a quantifiable aspect (e.g. temperature, distance, voltage, etc) of the observable system. Such investigations were labor-intensive and highly susceptible to human and measurement error. Once the data was collected, the scientist had to infer a model of the phenomena from the data. The mathemat- ical tools we had to describe phenomena were based on the assumption that the underlying behavior could be described by a line, or it could be made to if you squint hard enough.

He is a mechanical engineer and has always been interested in operation of human brain and the use of brain theory principles in human made intelligence systems. So in his graduate studies he set out on a journey to build a brain for an energy distribution system. The brain’s primary role would be to predict short term energy consumption of its clients from past experience and estimate the risk of prediction error. Based on this the system would determine its economically optimal operation. That would assure the system operating costs would be as low as possible while all the clients energy needs would be satisfied. After a successful birth of the first prediction brain an entrepreneurial bug bit him so he set out to use the prediction brains commercially in several district energy distribution systems.

The developed brains were using simulated neural networks and genetic algorithms to solve their tasks. But Marko still was not satisfied with the intelligence capabilities his brains were having. So now he is starting to examine the use of more sophisticated brain theory principles to autonomously solve given problems. He is especially interested in using Jeff Hawkins’ memory-prediction framework of the brain (Hierarchical Temporal Memory) for intelligent extraction of information from past experience. To effectively use this framework he needs to have more knowledge in the fields of neuroscience, dynamics of complex systems, etc. Armed with this knowledge maybe some day he will be able to answer his favorite problem of how to develop an intelligent system that autonomously extracts and understands the information available on the internet.

Whenever Marko is tired of playing with his artificial intelligence buddies he loves to interact and communicate with other people. In his free time he also practices some weird sport of golf, runs a lot and tries to devote as much time as possible to his princess.

Now he is setting out on a journey half across the world to a beautiful small town of Santa Fe to conquer new knowledge, form new friendships and have an unforgettable experience.

The title of my dissertation was ""Understanding the interplay of structure and dynamics in neuronal networks"", and much of my research has focused on questions in the field of neuroscience. Networks are very important in this field as the brain is a prime example of a very complicated network. Important features of neuronal networks are that the nodes (neurons) are dynamic due to the firing of action potentials, and the edges (synapses) are constantly evolving. The main part of my dissertation focused on a new clustering algorithm that utilizes these neuronal dynamics to detect groupings of neurons with similar firing patterns. I think that studying networks with dynamic nodes will become increasingly important as we try to apply network theory to more types of networks. Since neuronal networks can be viewed as time series of discrete events, I'd like to extend this line of thinking to types of networks outside of neuroscience, and I'm hoping that this workshop will be a good place to do so. In addition to the algorithm development and subsequent data analysis, much of my time in graduate school was spent doing experimental work growing dissociated hippocampal cultures and studying how the underlying structure of these networks influences their dynamics. I also spent some time doing computational modeling of epilepsy where I studied two coupled networks of neurons and looked at resonance and driving relationships between the networks as one network transitioned into seizure dynamics. Although this was my first project as a graduate student, my new postdoctoral position will also be in the field of epilepsy research. Network analysis is becoming increasingly important in epilepsy to study the initiation and propagation of seizures, so I'm quite excited to work in this area.

Ecological modeling of arrow bamboo,"Using two models (analysis of altitude-abundance patterns and an agent-based model) we demonstrate that global warming is a possible explanation of the declines of arrow bamboos in Mount Shennongjia, west-central China. Under two different scenarios (Temperature increments 1.5° C and 6 °C) both models predict upward shifts of bamboo populations. For the first scenario, the agent-based model also predicts serious reductions of the population of bamboo. For the second scenario the first model predicts serious declines (>%50) whereas extinction of the bamboo are predicted under the second model. Differences between the predicted bamboo populations and the models are due to the agent-based model’s inclusion of bamboo life history traits and competition with other plant species. It is important to monitor the dynamics of arrow bamboo because it is clear that this species is very susceptible to global warming and also because many species of animals subsist entirely on a diet of bamboo and reduction or extinction of this species could lead to extinction of these animals.",,Social and behavioural science,5,Wei Yang,Epidemiology,Health,"I'm a PhD student in genetic epidemiolgoy at Cardiovascular Institute & Fu Wai Hospital, Beijing.

Opinion spreading and consensus formation on complex networks,"We study a model of opinion spreading and consensus formation in a population on complex networks. Given a static network structure, the individuals can diffuse on it when two neighboring individuals’ opinions are beyond the “bounded confidence” ε. This is the case that arises in political situations while the opinions of voters can be adapted promptly after communication. The model is governed by the following two rules. At each time step, each individual can exchange their opinions with their neighbors if the difference of their opinions is smaller than ε; otherwise, one can move to an vacancy location if permitted. The distribution of opinions over the population evolves towards either a consensus that all individuals share the same opinion or polarization and fragmentation state. The statistical properties of this final state vary considerably as the model parameters change. It is shown that, when the dispersal abilities of the individuals are considered, the bounded confidence which is required to attain consensus can be remarkably decrease.",,Social and behavioural science,3,Liu Jianguo,Engineering,Engineering and engineering trades,"Hello, everyone.

Human Navigational Heuristics in Solving the Euclidean Travelling Salesman Problem,"Humans outperform, within limits, most algorithmic solutions in spatial optimization tasks, such as in the Euclidean Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). It has been recently suggested that people follow simple, perceptual heuristics – like preferring closed shapes or following the boundaries – rather than applying computationally expensive algorithms. In the present paper, human navigational heuristics were simulated in standard 10-nodes TSPs with different levels of difficulty. Within an agent-based model, an artificial travelling agent evaluates a disutility function at each step with respect to the distance to potential object, memory of previous routes taken, and the distance from home. The number of steps in each tour was recorded and solutions were analyzed. We conclude that human navigational heuristics can lead to near-optimal solutions in tasks like the TSP, and that solutions modelled herein are both cognitively feasible and efficiently robust to a variety of circumstance.

An Agent Based Model of Crisis-Driven Migration,"The literature on ethnic migration suggests that natural disasters, armed conflict, economics and cultural networks are key drivers of migration. The dearth of geo- referenced ethnic data, however, limits the value of econometric analysis. We build an agent-based model to simulate crisis-driven migration. Agents within a multi-ethnic population monitor their spatial environments to formulate perceptions of the risk of being persecuted. The expected utility of staying within a given neighborhood is inversely related to the perceived probability of persecution. Cultural networks temper an agent's security calculus, with strong social ties dampening the human security dilemma. Agents express preferences regarding the different ethnic groups in their spatial environment and social network. Social networks expand over time, but are often negatively impacted by exogenous social shocks. The resulting migratory patterns and ethnic clustering is a product of the confluence of event location and magnitude, ethnic tension, demographic factors and breadth of networks. Initial finding suggest that crisis- driven migration patterns are influenced by shock size and magnitude.","Sociology, Migration",Social and behavioural science,4,Michael Makowsky,Economics,Social and behavioural science,"I am currently a Ph.D. student in economics at George Mason University.

[1], [2] have presented a control theoretical approach for studying HSR in Escherichia coli bacteria. They argue that the complexity of the HSR control mechanism is necessary to achieve the observed robustness of such biological systems.
We extend the control theoretical approach, applying interval analysis to Lyapunov’s indirect method, and consider the robustness of the HSR with respect to uncertainties in the individual chemical reaction rates.

Ecological modeling of arrow bamboo,"Using two models (analysis of altitude-abundance patterns and an agent-based model) we demonstrate that global warming is a possible explanation of the declines of arrow bamboos in Mount Shennongjia, west-central China. Under two different scenarios (Temperature increments 1.5° C and 6 °C) both models predict upward shifts of bamboo populations. For the first scenario, the agent-based model also predicts serious reductions of the population of bamboo. For the second scenario the first model predicts serious declines (>%50) whereas extinction of the bamboo are predicted under the second model. Differences between the predicted bamboo populations and the models are due to the agent-based model’s inclusion of bamboo life history traits and competition with other plant species. It is important to monitor the dynamics of arrow bamboo because it is clear that this species is very susceptible to global warming and also because many species of animals subsist entirely on a diet of bamboo and reduction or extinction of this species could lead to extinction of these animals.",,Social and behavioural science,5,Gao Duo,Geology,Physical sciences,"Hi,everyone!

Opinion spreading and consensus formation on complex networks,"We study a model of opinion spreading and consensus formation in a population on complex networks. Given a static network structure, the individuals can diffuse on it when two neighboring individuals’ opinions are beyond the “bounded confidence” ε. This is the case that arises in political situations while the opinions of voters can be adapted promptly after communication. The model is governed by the following two rules. At each time step, each individual can exchange their opinions with their neighbors if the difference of their opinions is smaller than ε; otherwise, one can move to an vacancy location if permitted. The distribution of opinions over the population evolves towards either a consensus that all individuals share the same opinion or polarization and fragmentation state. The statistical properties of this final state vary considerably as the model parameters change. It is shown that, when the dispersal abilities of the individuals are considered, the bounded confidence which is required to attain consensus can be remarkably decrease.",,Social and behavioural science,3,Zhi-Xi Wu,Physics,Physical sciences,"Currently I am a second year Ph.D. candidate of Institute of Theoretical Physics at Lanzhou University.

Games on Evolving Networks,"Thispaperexploresthecoevolutionofnetworkformationandcooperativebehaviour.Ithas previously been shown that the structure of a community (for example, as formed by social relationships) can have a substantial impact on the evolution of cooperative behaviour. We hypothesize that the nature of the game played on such a network can alter the way that individuals make and break social connections, therefore leading to a feedback loop between the network structure and the behaviour in the game. We explore the dynamics of this process in a model where individuals form connections with others based on simple genetically encoded rules, and play one of a variety of two-player games with their connections. In order to explore the effects of different payoff structures in these games, simulations over a wide range of parameter space have been pursued, producing games including the Prisoner’s Dilemma, the Stag Hunt, and Hawk-Dove. By comparing to traditional game-theoretic models, we show that allowing the network structure to evolve prevents defectors from completely taking over the population, and also broadens the circumstances under which cooperation can fix. A first analysis of the properties of the networks created in these evolving populations suggests a mechanism for these results: when defectors are common, networks are created which tend to retard the effects of selection and encourage drift, while when cooperators are common, the networks formed tend to enhance selection and drive the population more quickly to the fully cooperative outcome.","Game Theory, Computer Sciencs",Social and behavioural science,5,Adrian de Froment,Biology,Life sciences,"I am a second year PhD student in Simon Levin's lab in the department of ecology and evolutionary biology at Princeton.

We investigate two encoding strategies, binary encoding and decimal encoding, in the SWA and test them by function optimization and 0- 1 multidimensional knapsack problems. Simulation studies show that compared with the corresponding genetic algorithm (GA) the SWA is capable of preserving diversity in the set of candidate solutions, avoiding premature of the population, overcoming the “GA deceptive problem” and it converges faster.

An Agent Based Model of Crisis-Driven Migration,"The literature on ethnic migration suggests that natural disasters, armed conflict, economics and cultural networks are key drivers of migration. The dearth of geo- referenced ethnic data, however, limits the value of econometric analysis. We build an agent-based model to simulate crisis-driven migration. Agents within a multi-ethnic population monitor their spatial environments to formulate perceptions of the risk of being persecuted. The expected utility of staying within a given neighborhood is inversely related to the perceived probability of persecution. Cultural networks temper an agent's security calculus, with strong social ties dampening the human security dilemma. Agents express preferences regarding the different ethnic groups in their spatial environment and social network. Social networks expand over time, but are often negatively impacted by exogenous social shocks. The resulting migratory patterns and ethnic clustering is a product of the confluence of event location and magnitude, ethnic tension, demographic factors and breadth of networks. Initial finding suggest that crisis- driven migration patterns are influenced by shock size and magnitude.","Sociology, Migration",Social and behavioural science,4,Patrick Meier,Law,Law,"I'm pursuing a PhD at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy based at Tufts University in Boston and my interests range from international conflict prevention and disaster early warning systems to complexity theory and network science.

Modeling the farming society: based on their climate perception and possibility of water trading during scarcity,"The emergence of cooperation in a virtual farming society is modeled here. This irrigating society is composed of an ensemble of N agents located near a river from where water is taken through diversion canals and distributed to the agent’s fields. Each agent makes two decisions every year regarding: (1) the type of crop mix to plant and (2) whether he joins, or not, a cooperative group that allocates water across farmers to maximize production and share revenues equally. Results of this work show that the degree to which farmers are willing to cooperate has a strong dependency on the mean river flows, thus on the climate of the region.",,Social and behavioural science,3,Aleix Serrat-Capdevilla,Hydrology,Engineering and engineering trades,"Hi all, I'm a PhD candidate in the Hydrology Department of the University of Arizona, minor in Anthropology.

Robustness Analysis of the Heat Shock Response using semiquantitative Reasoning,"The Heat Shock Response (HSR) is a universal procedure among organisms that repairs protein damage in- duced by heat and other stresses. It is a simple biological mechanism that is yet rich enough to be analyzed from the perspective of robustness and efficiency. A series of papers by El-Samad et al. [1], [2] have presented a control theoretical approach for studying HSR in Escherichia coli bacteria. They argue that the complexity of the HSR control mechanism is necessary to achieve the observed robustness of such biological systems.
We extend the control theoretical approach, applying interval analysis to Lyapunov’s indirect method, and consider the robustness of the HSR with respect to uncertainties in the individual chemical reaction rates. In order to design alternative control mechanisms for the HSR we compute the optimal control to the protein damage-repair cycle. Furthermore we propose a novel reduced order model of the HSR.",Biology,Social and behavioural science,5,Heinz Koeppl,Engineering,Engineering and engineering trades,"Heinz got his M.Sc. in Physics from Graz Karl-Franzens University, Austria and his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology from Graz University of Technology.

An Agent Based Model of Crisis-Driven Migration,"The literature on ethnic migration suggests that natural disasters, armed conflict, economics and cultural networks are key drivers of migration. The dearth of geo- referenced ethnic data, however, limits the value of econometric analysis. We build an agent-based model to simulate crisis-driven migration. Agents within a multi-ethnic population monitor their spatial environments to formulate perceptions of the risk of being persecuted. The expected utility of staying within a given neighborhood is inversely related to the perceived probability of persecution. Cultural networks temper an agent's security calculus, with strong social ties dampening the human security dilemma. Agents express preferences regarding the different ethnic groups in their spatial environment and social network. Social networks expand over time, but are often negatively impacted by exogenous social shocks. The resulting migratory patterns and ethnic clustering is a product of the confluence of event location and magnitude, ethnic tension, demographic factors and breadth of networks. Initial finding suggest that crisis- driven migration patterns are influenced by shock size and magnitude.","Sociology, Migration",Social and behavioural science,4,Jorge Tavares,Computer Science,Computing," Hi, my name is Jorge Tavares and I am a Computer Science PhD student, in the area of Evolutionary Computation, at the University of Coimbra.

Upon returning from China, I will begin a postdoc with the University of Western Ontario's Rotman Institute of Science and Values. My work is in two main areas: social/political philosophy, and the philosophy of science. My advisor at Penn was Cristina Bicchieri.

My dissertation was in political philosophy: in particular, I developed a new account of social contract theory that focused on how social contracts should function in diverse societies. This involved developing an account of perspectives (by which I mean a scheme of categorization and a search procedure), a novel moral standpoint - ""The View from Everywhere"", a bargaining approach that allows the participants to not have to agree over what they are bargaining over, and an account of toleration. This is the beginning of a larger project on diversity in social systems.

Smaller projects that I am also working in also revolve around issues with diversity. I'm in the midst of finishing a paper that got started by my CSSS work in '06 - a model of the Schelling Segregation Dynamic in which agents who want to be in the minority end up segregated anyway. I have also begun planning a follow-up paper on this topic that will (hopefully) show that if agents pay attention to different properties, there are more stable integrated states. The thought is that if some find race salient, while others find religion important, and still others find taste in music most salient, then there will be more of a chance that the macro view of the population will be integrated.

I also have been working on social norms. A paper I'm working on completing right now looks at the conditions under which multiple norms can be a stable state of an evolutionary game. In particular, what learning rules support such a stable state, and whether network structure of the population influences the equilibrium state.

In the philosophy of science, I have methodological interests, looking at the epistemic justifications of the tools of complex systems analysis. However, I am most interested in the social structure of science, particularly how incentive systems and methods of communication shape the output of science. I've coauthored a couple papers on this subject, developing an ""epistemic landscapes"" model of scientific sub-fields. Scientist-agents act as hill climbers on an unknown landscape. What I investigate is what methods of incorporating information about the attempts of other scientists is most conducive to maximizing social output. This project has been working with a model of implicit networks, but the next model iteration, which I hope will be able to describe longer timescales, will be moving to a dynamic explicit network structure.

Human Navigational Heuristics in Solving the Euclidean Travelling Salesman Problem,"Humans outperform, within limits, most algorithmic solutions in spatial optimization tasks, such as in the Euclidean Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). It has been recently suggested that people follow simple, perceptual heuristics – like preferring closed shapes or following the boundaries – rather than applying computationally expensive algorithms. In the present paper, human navigational heuristics were simulated in standard 10-nodes TSPs with different levels of difficulty. Within an agent-based model, an artificial travelling agent evaluates a disutility function at each step with respect to the distance to potential object, memory of previous routes taken, and the distance from home. The number of steps in each tour was recorded and solutions were analyzed.

Ecological modeling of arrow bamboo,"Using two models (analysis of altitude-abundance patterns and an agent-based model) we demonstrate that global warming is a possible explanation of the declines of arrow bamboos in Mount Shennongjia, west-central China. Under two different scenarios (Temperature increments 1.5° C and 6 °C) both models predict upward shifts of bamboo populations. For the first scenario, the agent-based model also predicts serious reductions of the population of bamboo. For the second scenario the first model predicts serious declines (>%50) whereas extinction of the bamboo are predicted under the second model. Differences between the predicted bamboo populations and the models are due to the agent-based model’s inclusion of bamboo life history traits and competition with other plant species. It is important to monitor the dynamics of arrow bamboo because it is clear that this species is very susceptible to global warming and also because many species of animals subsist entirely on a diet of bamboo and reduction or extinction of this species could lead to extinction of these animals.",,Social and behavioural science,5,Tongli Zhang,,,I am Tongli Zhang from Virginia Tech (http://mpf.biol.vt.edu/). looking forward to a great summer! ,,,,Virginia Tech,United States,201-300,2006,Beijing,Fabian,

The underlying structure of how diverse water system services and their users interact with the full range of the natural disturbances regime has been addressed rarely. The relationship of diversification and adaptive capacity remains largely unexplored.

The objective of my research is to evaluate how diversification of water system services and their use can support adaptive capacity in managed river basins at different scales in time and space.

One of the questions I would like to explore with you is the possibility of a consequential upper limit to diversification and robustness in the light of adaptive processes and external perturbations.

Based at the Centre for Water and Climate of Wageningen University and Research Centre, my research builds on the case study river basins and network of the European research project NeWater ([1]). Before joining the centre I worked as as policy advisor for the Dutch Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment and for the consultant Resource Analysis on assignments in Europe, Asia and the Americas.

Opinion spreading and consensus formation on complex networks,"We study a model of opinion spreading and consensus formation in a population on complex networks. Given a static network structure, the individuals can diffuse on it when two neighboring individuals’ opinions are beyond the “bounded confidence” ε. This is the case that arises in political situations while the opinions of voters can be adapted promptly after communication. The model is governed by the following two rules. At each time step, each individual can exchange their opinions with their neighbors if the difference of their opinions is smaller than ε; otherwise, one can move to an vacancy location if permitted. The distribution of opinions over the population evolves towards either a consensus that all individuals share the same opinion or polarization and fragmentation state. The statistical properties of this final state vary considerably as the model parameters change. It is shown that, when the dispersal abilities of the individuals are considered, the bounded confidence which is required to attain consensus can be remarkably decrease.",,Social and behavioural science,3,Feng Wang,Computer Science,Computing,"Hello, everyone!

Robustness Analysis of the Heat Shock Response using semiquantitative Reasoning,"The Heat Shock Response (HSR) is a universal procedure among organisms that repairs protein damage in- duced by heat and other stresses. It is a simple biological mechanism that is yet rich enough to be analyzed from the perspective of robustness and efficiency. A series of papers by El-Samad et al. [1], [2] have presented a control theoretical approach for studying HSR in Escherichia coli bacteria. They argue that the complexity of the HSR control mechanism is necessary to achieve the observed robustness of such biological systems.
We extend the control theoretical approach, applying interval analysis to Lyapunov’s indirect method, and consider the robustness of the HSR with respect to uncertainties in the individual chemical reaction rates. In order to design alternative control mechanisms for the HSR we compute the optimal control to the protein damage-repair cycle. Furthermore we propose a novel reduced order model of the HSR.",Biology,Social and behavioural science,5,,,,,,,,,,,2006,Santa Fe,Fabian,"V.

The Dynamics and Semantics of Collaborative Tagging,"The debate within the Web community over the optimal means by which to organize information often pits formalized classifications (such as the Semantic Web) against distributed collaborative tagging systems. A number of questions remain unanswered, however, regarding the nature of collaborative tag- ging systems including the dynamics of such systems and whether coherent clas- sification schemes can emerge from the user community. Currently millions of users are using collaborative tagging without centrally organizing principles for tagging behavior, which marks a system exhibiting features considered to be in- dicative of a complex system. If this is the case, it remains to be seem whether user behavior over time leads to emergent classification schemes that could be formalized by the Semantic Web.
This paper uses data from “popular” and newly tagged sites on the social book- marking site del.icio.us to examine the dynamics of such collaborative tagging systems, in particular whether the distribution of tag frequencies stabilizes, indi- cating a degree of cohesion or consensus among users about the optimal tags to describe particular sites. We use tag co-occurrence networks for a sample domain of tags to analyze the meaning of particular tags given their relationship to other tags (using a structuralist approach to meaning) and automatically create an on- tology. We also produce a generative model of collaborative tagging in order to model and understand some of the basic dynamics behind the process.",Computer Science,Social and behavioural science;Computing,3,Valentin Robu,Computer Science,Computing," I am a third-year PhD student at CWI, Dutch National Research Center for Mathematics and Computer Science, Amsterdam.
My research mostly deals with simulation of electronic markets as coordination mechanisms between autonomous, self-interested agents. There are two main perspectives to be considered in this research: 1. modeling the structure of the market itself, such as to insure some desirable properties (e.g. incentive compatibility, revenue equivalence etc.), 2. modeling the preferences, risk attitude, learning and adaptation of the participating agents themselves and examining (through simulations) the effect they have, both on individual agent outcomes and the reached market equilibrium. In my work, I mostly take the second approach. In order to model agent learning, I use a variety of techniques including probabilistic learning, evolutionary computation, RL etc. If you want to know more about it, here is my homepage.

The Effects of Network Structure and Dynamics in Complex Systems,,Networks,Computing,6,Carver Tate,"Communication, Culture, Technology",Journalism and information,"Hello, my name is Carver and I am from New York City. I am currently a graduate student at Georgetown University in the Communication, Culture, and Technology Program. I have not chosen a specific topic for my thesis yet, but my interests include the effects of technology on society (both past and present), the problem of information overload in society and how we might create new ways of processing information to make it more manageable, and developing a more interconnected approach to globalization studies that reflects how each element of globalization effects the other. I see complexity theory relating to each of these interests in different ways. With respect to the effects of technology on society, technological innovation and diffusion has followed the traditional S shaped curve and has been shown to mimic the Kondratiev wave. If these patterns are studied more in-depthly it might be possible to make more accurate projections about whether the rate of technological growth and innovation will remain the same or increase in the future. In terms of information overload, I think complexity theory can offer news ways of classifying how ""complex"" a given piece of information is and offer the simplest way of navigating it. Visual simulations of complex information can also offer a new and more easily digestible format, the same way a traditional x-y graph makes it easier to see the behavior and draw conclusions about a function. Finally, up until this point globalization studies have focused on specific parts of globalization such as economics or culture, but there has yet to be an approach that tries to see how all aspects of globalization are connected and effect one another. I think complexity theory offers the best method for trying to synthesize these different areas and creating a more holistic approach, viewing globalization as more of a complex adaptive system. I do not come from a math or computer science background, so my knowledge of each area is very limited. I have been brushing up on calculus and differential equations for the past month and hope that I have learned enough to at least be able to speak the language, but any help from my fellow summer programmers would be greatly appreciated. Also, if there is anyone else in my situation (someone coming from more of a social science/cultural background) I would love to speak with you about how you see complexity theory fitting into your area of interest.

Given the novel features of quantum mechanics (superposition, entanglement,..) what are the novel manifestations of these in observable processes? More specifically, I've been trying to understand how entanglement augments properties of these small quantum systems. It takes a fair amount of experimental effort to produce a nice clean pair of entangled electrons. What do you get for it?

Exploring healing strategies on Random Boolean Networks,,Biology?,Computing,5,Amitabh Trehan,Computer Science,Computing,"I am working towards a PhD in Computer Science at the University of New Mexico.

My current research is towards developing self-healing algorithms for reconfigurable networks. Reconfigurable networks are networks in which we can add links when needed such as peer-to-peer networks. My advisor Prof. Saia Jared Saia and I are attempting to develop algorithms for efficient reconnections (in terms of some invariants and resource costs) in such networks under attack. We are looking for (and finding) interesting connections in other areas such as electrical circuits and many biological/ecological systems.

Recently, I have also been interested in populations dynamics modelling using coupled differential equations, a project from a NonLinear Dynamics course I took this semester.

I hope to extend these projects during the summer school with the help of enthusiastic experts :)

Otherwise, I am interested in learning about almost everyting around (unless the maths is too complicated!) me and also things in outer space (cosmology). I have an undergraduate degree in Biology. I dabbled a bit in phonetics (and multilingual typesetting (LaTeX), computer codes) too, which formed the subject for my M.Tech. thesis.

For example, how can the design of social and political institutions solve social dilemmas and when is coercion justified? Or, what principles of justice would we choose if we did not know how wealthy our parents will be and what native abilities we will be lucky to have? These intersect with questions in philosophy of science; for example, what probabilistic inferences should we draw from our experiences and was Popper right to be an inductive skeptic? (These questions are, of course, also relevant to epistemology and to statistical learning theory.) From time to time, I also worry about the robustness of computational models. Recently, as a way to intermittently procrastinate while studying for my comps, I have also taken a keen interest in urban planning/geography, especially the relationship between walkability, population density and urban spatial structure.

I am interested in statistical physics, nonlinear dynamics and their applications to complex systems. Some of the research projects that I have been involved in are about: Transient dynamics in some diffusion-reaction systems for which the analytic solutions for traveling waves are known, theory of molecular motion on cell membranes based on the compartmentalized structure of the membranes and social network analysis in the context of anthropology and political science. I am also interested in transport phenomena in networks and synchronization in nature. And I am hoping to narrow down my interests soon!

I am currently a graduate student at Georgetown University in the Communication, Culture, and Technology Program. I have not chosen a specific topic for my thesis yet, but my interests include the effects of technology on society (both past and present), the problem of information overload in society and how we might create new ways of processing information to make it more manageable, and developing a more interconnected approach to globalization studies that reflects how each element of globalization effects the other. I see complexity theory relating to each of these interests in different ways. With respect to the effects of technology on society, technological innovation and diffusion has followed the traditional S shaped curve and has been shown to mimic the Kondratiev wave. If these patterns are studied more in-depthly it might be possible to make more accurate projections about whether the rate of technological growth and innovation will remain the same or increase in the future. In terms of information overload, I think complexity theory can offer news ways of classifying how ""complex"" a given piece of information is and offer the simplest way of navigating it. Visual simulations of complex information can also offer a new and more easily digestible format, the same way a traditional x-y graph makes it easier to see the behavior and draw conclusions about a function. Finally, up until this point globalization studies have focused on specific parts of globalization such as economics or culture, but there has yet to be an approach that tries to see how all aspects of globalization are connected and effect one another. I think complexity theory offers the best method for trying to synthesize these different areas and creating a more holistic approach, viewing globalization as more of a complex adaptive system. I do not come from a math or computer science background, so my knowledge of each area is very limited. I have been brushing up on calculus and differential equations for the past month and hope that I have learned enough to at least be able to speak the language, but any help from my fellow summer programmers would be greatly appreciated. Also, if there is anyone else in my situation (someone coming from more of a social science/cultural background) I would love to speak with you about how you see complexity theory fitting into your area of interest.

My current research is towards developing self-healing algorithms for reconfigurable networks. Reconfigurable networks are networks in which we can add links when needed such as peer-to-peer networks. My advisor Prof. Saia Jared Saia and I are attempting to develop algorithms for efficient reconnections (in terms of some invariants and resource costs) in such networks under attack. We are looking for (and finding) interesting connections in other areas such as electrical circuits and many biological/ecological systems.

Recently, I have also been interested in populations dynamics modelling using coupled differential equations, a project from a NonLinear Dynamics course I took this semester.

I hope to extend these projects during the summer school with the help of enthusiastic experts :)

I'm also a Ph.D student in the Communications Research (CoRe) Group at Uppsala University.

My broad research area is computer systems and networking. I'm currently studying communication in autonomous wireless networks and trying to address the problem of energy-efficient coordination of access to the shared wireless channel in a multihop wireless environment, such as ad hoc and sensor networks. I especially enjoy working on problems where I can do practical system implementation and experimentation work and look at the system behavior analytically, as well.

I applied to attend the summer school because I think it may be interesting to think about the problem of coordinating channel access in a complex systems context. In a multihop wireless network, contention and interference effects generally extend further than the data communication range. As a result, senders have to decide when to transmit, despite having incomplete knowledge of both conflicting transmissions and the impact of their transmissions on the network.

So one of my goals this summer is to learn about complex systems techniques to see whether there is some interesting way to model the problem of coordinating channel access. But I'm also excited to learn from and collaborate with people working on all sorts of interesting problems...

In my free time, I enjoy travel and photography.

Modeling Therapeutic Intervention In Sepsis,,"Biology, Medicine",Health,2,Mauricio Rosas,Medicine,Health,"My main research interest is related to regulation of inflammation by autonomic nervous system. Specifically, my thesis work addresses the anatomical and molecular pathway by which electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve attenuates systemic inflammation in an animal model of sepsis.

Sepsis is a health issue because of its high incidence, mortality and economical cost. Despite several years of research and clinical trials testing promising drugs, sepsis is considered to be an intractable disease. In part, this is so because current experimental and therapeutic strategies designed to harness inflammation are based on our understanding of a system with linear dynamics. More recently, however, the process of sepsis has been formulated in terms of complexity theory. Bodily organization and function are conceived as an emergent property of a non-linear, non-equilibrium system organized as a scale-free network. Loss of homeostasis in sepsis is perceived as the progression from a stable behavioral pattern or attractor to another characterized by organ dysfunction as a consequence of reduced connectedness between the system’s elements.

Detection of low-dimensional chaos in quasi-periodic time series: The 0-1 test,,Dynamics,Mathematics and statistics,6,Samuel Laney,"Ecology, Electrical Engineering",Life sciences;Engineering and engineering trades,"I go by ""Sam"" and I'm currently a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. Nominally I'm a phytoplankton ecologist, as well as an electrical engineer, and most of my scientific work to date has been in the fields of oceanography and marine photosynthesis. But, I have broad interests and am eager to learn more this June about the applications you have for complexity science in your own research, and how this may overlap into issues in mine.

I'm interested in complexity science because I think it might shed some light on some longstanding questions in marine phytoplankton ecology. It seems odd how algae, being photosynthetic, are able to survive in the ocean when their light environment fluctuates so dramatically. Why is it that what works best in the most complex light environment is contained in possibly the most simple photosynthetic organisms. What strategies do phytoplankton employ for survival? How can we learn about these strategies, given the few photosynthetic properties that we can measure in the natural environment?",,Male,Postdoc,Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,United States,Not University,2008,Santa Fe,Emily,

I'm also a Ph.D student in the Communications Research (CoRe) Group at Uppsala University.

My broad research area is computer systems and networking. I'm currently studying communication in autonomous wireless networks and trying to address the problem of energy-efficient coordination of access to the shared wireless channel in a multihop wireless environment, such as ad hoc and sensor networks. I especially enjoy working on problems where I can do practical system implementation and experimentation work and look at the system behavior analytically, as well.

I applied to attend the summer school because I think it may be interesting to think about the problem of coordinating channel access in a complex systems context. In a multihop wireless network, contention and interference effects generally extend further than the data communication range. As a result, senders have to decide when to transmit, despite having incomplete knowledge of both conflicting transmissions and the impact of their transmissions on the network.

So one of my goals this summer is to learn about complex systems techniques to see whether there is some interesting way to model the problem of coordinating channel access. But I'm also excited to learn from and collaborate with people working on all sorts of interesting problems...

In my free time, I enjoy travel and photography.

economic development process (especially the way in which income and 
health mutually reinforce each other) occurs in a nonlinear way. Any 
project that focused this health-wealth link would be interesting to me.
 One specific idea would be to model the impact of infectious disease

ill-health. The model could investigate whether and how these dynamics 
produce poverty traps.

This is “my profile release 2.0”, including exciting updates such as a 
new profile picture and answers to Dan’s questions as they are posted in
 the homepage. 


I am student of philosophy at San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy. I 
am a jr. researcher in “Experimental and Applied Epistemology”  @ CRESA,  and a jr. researcher in “Life-Span Extension Methodologies” @ iLabs. I am currently figuring out what these strange tags actually mean. 


My B.A. dissertation was on foundational issues in ontology and I am 
still spending part of my life convincing myself that I do not exist. In
 my M.A. dissertation I’d like to shed some new light on the concept of 
“complexity” borrowing tools from formal ontology and philosophical 
logic. I strongly feel that a qualitative theory of information is 
needed to make sense of how complexity emerges from low-level 
simplicity, but unfortunately I now have just some vague clues of how 
such a theory may look like. I hope CSSS will help me figuring out if 
all this work makes more sense than the previous one. 


'simplex sigillum veri' has always been my favorite motto since my first
 B.A. year, but I think I’ll switch to 'complex sigillum veri' before

I've been for the last 5 years or so. I moved to Davis (near Sacramento)
 in 2007 from San Francisco to start a PhD in Applied Mathematics.
My academic interests are in dynamical networks, particularly 
ones that resemble our brains in some abstract way. I studied 
neuroscience at MIT as an undergrad, motivated by the prospects of 
replicating intelligence in machines and understanding a bit better this
 very machine that is currently constructing this silly self-referential
 sentence. 
Here's a few beliefs I have;

We have a lot to learn from nature, and biology in specific. 
It's had several billion years to get its act together and its latest 
presentation is quite impressive.Brains are only one example of a wide class of complex networks 
which can compute things or otherwise act ""intelligently"".  Nature found
 one path, but it doesn't mean there aren't a whole host of other ones. 
What's common between various classes of these networks?By studying the neurophisiologicafunctional basis of animal 
intelligence, I think humans can hope to help humanity in at least a 
couple of ways:
Contributing to our own self knowledge.  There are some pretty 
simple lessons that have had deep impacts on my life when looked at 
through certain glasses. Let me give you an example. Donald Hebb
 one of the first greats in theoretical neuroscience proposed that 
""neurons that fire together wire together."" Over the last 60 years this 
has been repeatedly verified empirically. If you think about it, what it
 means is that whatever perceptions or behaviors you are partaking in at
 the same time will later become more likely to occur simultaneously. 
This is enormously powerful once we understand it.  It means we can work
 to break ourselves of old habits and form new patterns of behavior that
 serve our lives.Building machines that do menial or repetitive tasks for us.  Face 
it, you want a robot to drive you around. Or to go find you a bunch of 
cool new music that you probably will like.
I've enjoyed reading about the specifics of people's academic work on
 here, so why don't I just plagiarize myself briefly and copy over a 
paragraph from my CSSS application which summarizes my academic self as 
well as anything:


I want to understand intelligent perception and behavior by building,
 analyzing and finding patterns in and characteristics of complex 
dynamical networks. The central question I am interested in addressing 
is: given a mathematical description for internal as well as intra-node 
dynamics, how do patterns in the structural topology of a dynamical 
network predictably give rise to patterns in its functional behavior. Or
 more compactly: how does structure map to function of a network?


This
 is a recent project I completed on studying the ways in which networks 
of spiking neurons can generate interesting patterns. It probably raised
 more questions for me than I answered, but perhaps thats a good thing?

statistical physics and non-linear dynamics,linguistics and network 
analyses. I am also interested in the history of science as complex 
system. Some time in the future I would love to take a closer look at 
cell signaling, neuroscience, cognitive science and biophysics. I enjoy 
reading urtexts from the era when science was called natural philosophy 
and when the earlier attempt of the complexity approach still reined. 
I decided to embark on scientific career at the age of 12 by 
joining an astronomy club in my hometown, which led me eventually to 
studying theoretical physics with specialization in astrophysics and to 
working in one of the biggest in Europe (and I believe the best :)) 
astrophysical observatories. For my past participation in astronomical 
expeditions to some hard-accessible regions of the world I was accepted 
this year into the New York chapter of the Explorers club  ""http://www.explorers.org/"".
My experience in the Observatory included both collecting data, 
by making observations on the 2.6 m diameter optical telescope (with 
especially unforgettable long cold winter nights when sky is especially 
clear), and analysing the data via building quantitative models of 
stellar atmospheres and computer experiments. Multi-skilled requirements
 for a scientist and interdisciplinary approach were essential for the 
Observatory's reseach culture, triggering my interest in complex 
systems.
I also developed interest in linguistics and learned English, 
Italian and Greek in addition to my native Russian, thus taking samples 
out of four different language groups of the Indo-European family. 
Currently, I am planning to add Sanskrit to my collection and I am very 
interested in the quantitative approach to the problem of 
proto-languages. I also have a long-standing interest in comparative 
mythology, which probably every astrophysicist necessarily develops via 
wondering about the origin of constellations. Some time in the future I 
would love to take a closer look at the paleoclimatology and at the 
links uniting all these seemingly different fields of study.
After realizing the extend of the power of economic forces over 
the life of societies and over the life of scientific networks and how, 
in fact, little understood and developed this branch of science is, I 
went to New York to study quantitative finance, got some financial 
markets experience and attended since autumn 2006 the New York 
Quantitative Finance seminar, thus getting the first-row-seat 
observation point at the financial crisis of 2008 and at the attempts to
 analyze it.
I would say that my biggest interest at this point is in the ways
 to develop new quantitative risk measures applicable to the global 
financial markets, perhaps by applying the methods of network analysis. 
In addition, I am interested in studies of sustainability of 
companies, cities and societies as complex adaptive systems, in studies 
of information flow in complex networks and in the studies of how the 
dynamics of the knowledge diffusion affects technologies and innovation.
 I'm interested in the quantitative studies of what causes instability 
and collapses of the financial markets and societies as complex 
networks. Perhaps it's good time to apply what we have learned from hard
 sciences to find a sound way towards stability and optimization, which 
would in turn allow us to concentrate on our Das Glasperlenspiel. At 
least, that's the idea.

I am a 3rd year Italian PhD student at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, in Leuven, Belgium. 
I also belong to Leuven's Interuniversity MicroElectronic Center (IMEC).
My field of research is mesoscopic self-assembly. Specifically, I am 
developing new techniques to improve the packaging and assembly of 
microchip. This (rather dull) task starts to appear exciting once you 
introduce stochastic techniques and self-assembling processes to work it
 out. It seems weird, and even weirder when it works!
Anyway, this was only the n-th trail that lead me to the galaxy of complex systems. This might well be something one wants to report to a psycotherapist.
I started getting interested in complexity by the end of my 
high-school years. At that time, to show my embarassing modesty, I 
wanted to write an interdisciplinary thesis on complexity. Unluckily, 
the boundaries of my books where to narrow to contain my notes (I guess 
someone said this already a few centuries ago), so I decided to change 
topic - I switched to ""space and time"", not sure I simplified my task. 
Anyhow, since then I started pursuing a (mostly self-taught) 
educational path through self-organization, dynamical systems, pattern 
formation, critical phenomena, evolutionary computation, artificial 
intelligence. For my BS thesis, I looked into phase-looked loops, whose 
functionality is built on non-linear dynamics. For my MS thesis, I

Geography and Regional Research of the University Vienna, Austria.
My research interests and activities include both, 
process-oriented and applied research on natural hazards and risk. One 
special focus is on the spatial and temporal evolution of risk and I 
conducted studies on the variability of natural hazard processes as well
 as of values at risk.
I believe that one of the fundamental reasons for the lack of 
progress regarding natural hazard risk is the continuing separation of 
the research on natural processes and social processes without 
considering interaction between these systems. Therefore, an objective 
is to develop more balanced analyses of risks associated with the 
interaction of socio-economic and geophysical processes.
My current research places emphasis to develop a conceptual model

insights in the two-way interaction between landscape and human systems.
 In this context the implications of complexity theory are a promising

Foraging on the Move,"n this project we develop a model for organisms that forage in groups while migrating (e.g. caribou, wildebeest), to understand how individuals should balance foraging and flocking behaviors.","Biology, Ecology",Life sciences,5,Steven Lade,Physics,Physical Sciences,"To the extent that labels work any more in these sorts of fields, I'm
 a theoretical physicist. I'm undertaking a PhD at the Nonlinear Physics
 Centre at The Australian National University under the supervision of 
Prof Yuri Kivshar. Most of the group works on nonlinear optics -- 
solitons, optical lattices, nonlinear vortices, etc. really nice 
nonlinear dynamics in other words -- or phenomena with similar equations
 of motion like Bose-Einstein condensates.
I, meanwhile, have been looking at a class of models called 
ratchets. In short these are systems periodic in space and time which 
achieve a nonzero average velocity through breaking of spatial and/or 
temporal symmetry. For example, a particle in a sawtooth potential 
(which is flat on average) under the influence of an additional 
oscillating force (zero on average) which through the combination of 
these forces moves on average in one direction. Such a ratchet could be 
implemented in lots of different areas, but historically the one people 
were focusing on were (processive) molecular motors like myosin-V and 
kinesin which also move without any net bias telling them which way to 
go.
This got me onto molecular motors. I'm not really looking at them
 in a ratchet sense any more. What I have is access to some 
single-molecule time series for their motion (nm in space and us in 
time!), trying to convert this data into an effective equation motion in
 order to uncover details about its dynamics and mechanical structure, 
and comparing against simulations another collaborator is doing.
Is this complex systems? Probably not. I'm looking at everything 
in a rather reductionist manner. In fact, despite having attended some 
other complex systems events, I still don't really know what complex 
systems are. That's one reason I applied to come to the summer school! 
The other reason is that, as you can hopefully tell from the above, I'm 
interested in interdisciplinary work. These sorts of events, and Santa 
Fe in particular, seem to be where people of a like mind tend to hang 
out, so let's meet up and do some collaborating! -- even if it's not 
necessarily on complex systems.
Outside of work, among other things I'm keen on outdoor 
activities, mainly bushwalking (which you'd call hiking or backpacking, I
 think). I'd like to do some while at Santa Fe, it sounds like a great

agent operates with an autonomous localized set of rules, these rules 
typically involve interactions among agents and with the agents’ 
environment, presenting challenges when attempting to simulate very 
large populations of agents.  At the same time, the scaling properties 
of complex adaptive systems are such that it is important to study the 
properties of an ABM over wide ranges of population size.  This is 
because the emergent properties of a system typically change with scope 
and scale: mammalian basal metabolic rate scales sublinearly with animal
 mass, and incidence of crime in a city scales superlinearly with city 
population size.  This presentation describes work proposed towards

techniques to understand complex systems.  My doctoral work has focused 
on neuroscience however my interests are much more broad. Many fields 
such as economics and ecology where there are interesting questions 
concerning the behavioral prediction of complicated systems are 
interesting to me.    
I am currently a Ph.D. Student in Computational Neuroscience at 
the University of California, San Diego and the Salk Institute for 
Biological Studies.  I will be graduating this winter.  My thesis work 
is focused on quantitatively characterizing neural arbor shape in terms 
of probability density functions.  Because fitting a function to a 
neural arbor is hard, I measure the moments of the arbors directly from 3
 dimensionally reconstructed neurons (A probability density function can
 be described by it's moments).  Investigation of neural arbor moments 
reveal that arbors are statistically self similar to one another.  
Statistical self similarity reveals that neural arbors density functions
 have the same basic shape.  It also reveals the  parameters that are 
needed to characterize the probability density function of an arbor.  I 
investigate different pre-classified types of arbors in terms of these 
parameters and show that there are differences between different types 
of arbors but there is a lot of overlap between them.
My thesis work has involved techniques from neuroscience, physics
 (derivation of scaling relationship in arbors), biostatistics & 
machine learning (data analysis, probability density estimation, cluster
 analysis), data mining (extracting information from a large data base 
of neurons), signal processing (spike train analysis) and experimental 
electrophysiology (measuring ion channel conductances).
As far as projects go I am pretty flexible.  I would generally be

Application of Network Clustering Methods to Gene Expression Profiling Data,"We present the application of two new unsupervised clustering methods
 to gene expression data.  The methods, partition decoupling (PDM) and 
commute time distance (CTD), are based upon the spectral analysis of the
 correlation structure of the data.  Because they have the ability to 
reveal non-linear and non-convex geometries present in the data, 
spectral clustering based approaches are an improvement over typical 
linear clustering algorithms.  Here, we apply these methods to a 
publicly-available gene expression data set, and demonstrate that we are
 able to identify cell types and treatments with higher accuracy than is
 obtained through other approaches.

Approaches to Panarchy,"Panarchy refers to a nested set of interacting dynamical systems, each one cycling over a hierarchy of scales in time and space. This concept provides a framework for thinking about complex systems in ecology, economics, sociology, etc. We consider novel examples and applications of panarchy.","Physics, Mathematics",Physical sciences;Mathematics and statistics,3,Damian Winters,Environmental Science,Environmental protection,"Hi everyone.  I'm excited to meet you all shortly and I am happy to 
be part of this group.  I became interested in the subject through 
undergraduate and graduate research on environmental change and the 
implications for social systems.  I recently graduated from the 
University for Peace (in Costa Rica) where I did my MA in Environmental 
Security and Peace.  My thesis used complex systems theories to explore 
the types of management structures used for measurement and evaluation 
of environmental peacemaking programs.  I generally found that the 
organizational structures were too rigid to sustain long-term programs. 
 I think I really became interested in the topic when I picked up Panarchy
 by Gunderson and Holling.  This book influenced the way I thought about
 organization and change in the environment (excluding humans) and the 
similarities that can be drawn to social systems.  Also, the Complex Forest
 by Carol Colfer, was a great example of trying to apply the theories 
through participatory action research.  I am now finishing up work with 
an international development organization where I was helping to build 
robust, multi-stakeholder development programs that could withstand 
perturbations in the economic, political, and social arenas.
There are several things that I would like to look at during this summer program:

How complex adaptive systems modeling can better inform environmental peacemaking initiatives;Social system hierarchies and points where change can occur;The differences between systems that move towards optimization and those that move towards improvement;Creating Boolean functions that reflect an adaptive approach to environmental management and the constraints in doing so;and a larger interest of mine is how does spirituality fit into all of this?
My expertise will come mostly from my background in real-world 
applications of complex adaptive systems theories.  I hope that by the 
end of the summer I will have a better sense of how CS could provide 
alternative management systems for environmental peacemaking projects.  I
 am also eager to learn about how people in other fields will view and 
use this knowledge.  I do not have a concrete idea for a project just 
yet but I am looking forward to coming up with projects in such an 
interdisciplinary group.
See you soon!

 CSSS sounds like an exciting opportunity for an interdisciplinary

I am a 3rd year Italian PhD student at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, in Leuven, Belgium. 
I also belong to Leuven's Interuniversity MicroElectronic Center (IMEC).
My field of research is mesoscopic self-assembly. Specifically, I am 
developing new techniques to improve the packaging and assembly of 
microchip. This (rather dull) task starts to appear exciting once you 
introduce stochastic techniques and self-assembling processes to work it
 out. It seems weird, and even weirder when it works!
Anyway, this was only the n-th trail that lead me to the galaxy of complex systems. This might well be something one wants to report to a psycotherapist.
I started getting interested in complexity by the end of my 
high-school years. At that time, to show my embarassing modesty, I 
wanted to write an interdisciplinary thesis on complexity. Unluckily, 
the boundaries of my books where to narrow to contain my notes (I guess 
someone said this already a few centuries ago), so I decided to change 
topic - I switched to ""space and time"", not sure I simplified my task. 
Anyhow, since then I started pursuing a (mostly self-taught) 
educational path through self-organization, dynamical systems, pattern 
formation, critical phenomena, evolutionary computation, artificial 
intelligence. For my BS thesis, I looked into phase-looked loops, whose 
functionality is built on non-linear dynamics. For my MS thesis, I 
investigated (microelectromechanical) resonators, acquiring a taste for 
these fundamental and ubiquitous objects. Meanwhile, I was feeding on 
books by Kosko, Kauffman, Gell-Mann, Deutsch, Penrose, Barabasi, 
Strogatz, Axelrod and more. I can candidly confess I am still addicted. 
Abusing of crack might be much cheaper.
Finally, I lately realized I probably want (a subset of) this 
stuff to be the leading theme of my future career. So I thought CSSS 
might be the right place to start this private phase transition.
My other interests include playing and composing music, singing in polyphonic choirs, reading, running and write satire and short essays (Italian only, so far).

My research interests include but not limited to complex 
networks, nonlinear dynamics,systems biology and traditional Chinese 
medicine, in particularly the acupuncture. To my understanding, it may 
be understood from the context of complex networks.
I have been working in a highly inter-disciplined group underProf. Li Baowen,
 who is one of the founding fathers of the emerging field “Phononics”. 
The group has about 30 members including visitors, postdocs, Ph.D 
students, undergraduate students and even high school students. They 
come from different background, such as physics, biology, electronic 
engineering, and material science and engineering … I really enjoy such 
academic atmosphere and it is why I am so enthusiastic to join Santa 
Fe’s summer school.
In the past two years, when i done my master at University of Science and Technology of China(USTC),I
 have used the physics approach such as the concept of Anderson 
localization, structure entropy etc  to study the dynamics of complex 
network, and have already done the works "" Localizations on complex networks"" and something about fractal.
I hope I can work with people from different background to study a
 common interested problem from different approaches from this summer 
school, so that I will learn to look the same problem from different 
angles, and of course, I will see  how my physics background can be used
 to solve other relevant problems.
In addition to research, I love life, love to boil soup (included
 red beans, black beans.....) and cook delicious meals according to 
recipes from the traditional Chinese medicine.  I am also very amazing 
about the foot reflexology.  
I also like to play Badminton, YOGA, Belly dance, singing, reading novels, and travel~~

My thesis research centers around the question of why organisms 
migrate, but touches on a variety of related questions, including:

How do organisms trade off movement in space (e.g. migration) and in time (e.g. dormancy)?Why and how do organisms synchronize their behavior?How do organisms balance different types of information (e.g. personal, social, genetic) when making decisions?How are groups formed and to what extent to individual retain their identity within a group?How does individual variation result in different behavioral strategies being used?
I use a combination of modeling, simulations and fieldwork in my research.


I have an ScB in Applied Mathematics--Biology so my background is a mix 
of biology and math.  I've taken courses in the potentially relevant 
areas of Chaos & Nonlinear Dynamics, and Information Theory, and do 
most of my modeling in MATLAB.

The Effect of Leverage on Financial Markets,"When people get excited about their prospects on the stock market, they 
borrow money from the bank to invest. This leverage effectively couples 
the bank to the stock market. Thus, interest rates determine demand for 
stock, and demand for stock can determine interest rates. Does this 
interplay cause traders to naturally find a stable balance of leverage 
and aggressiveness? How do the behavioral traits of traders influence 
the stability of these interactions? Are there regulatory behaviors, 
such as limiting leverage or slowing margin calls, that would contribute
 to the overall health of the market?  We present an economy consisting 
of a banking sector and an equity market, with traders transferring 
money between the two.  Using an agent-based model, we will be able to 
examine how leverage couples the bank to the equities market.  
Furthermore, we can explore how different leverage strategies effects 
the stability of these markets.

"Innovation, Sustainability and Growth of Human Social Organizations from Cities to Corporations","The intent of this research is to build on the successful body of work that has already begun
at SFI on developing a broad fundamental, quantitative, predictive theory of social
organizations. A major component is to understand the role of innovation and adaptability in
shaping the growth and sustainability of cities to corporations. Such a theoretical framework
is potentially very powerful for a company like Boeing in helping to recognize and understand
that its growth, evolution and development have been constrained by general ""laws"" which
may have important implications for its long-term survivability. Such laws reflect the
general dynamical and structural properties of the multiple underlying networks of the
organization itself as well as its relationship with the broader business community. This is
manifested in generic scaling laws that indicate that organizations that participate in a
business/economic ecology did not evolve, grow and adapt either ""randomly"" or in a planned
controlled manner but were subject to dynamical laws. From a research perspective we
view Boeing as a ""case study"" by providing data and significant support for the research.
The project will be focused on understanding these big questions by seeking to reveal the
underlying principles, constraints and dynamics independent of the details by which
companies grow and evolve driven by innovation (their ""coarse-grained behavior"").

 developing world.  Within law, my areas of interest include 
intellectual property, technology law, and criminal law.  My current 
research involves investigating the impact of gender imbalance (more 
women than men in a population or vice-versa) and information 
availability on marriage markets.
Prior to coming to GMU to study economics and law, I was a 
controls and project engineer working in the power industry.  I have a 
degree in mechanical engineering from Virginia Tech and an MBA from the 
University of Florida.
Besides my work and studies, I love to travel.  I’ve made it to 
28 countries, 7 continents (including Antarctica), and 50 states so far.
  I enjoy kayaking (probably not too much of that in the desert), 
camping, reading, and road trips just about anywhere and everywhere.
I look forward to meeting everyone this summer.  In the meantime, you can e-mail me at hollar@mindspring.com.

In 2001, I started my own company ITINERA Management Services & Consulting focusing on:

    project portfolio and program management
    complexity and systems thinking
    knowledge and networks
    science & philosophy
    personal process reengineering

As management consultant, I partner with Quint Wellington Redwood, a leading IT management consulting company.

In 2009, I became chairman of the think thank of the Royal Society of Flemish Engineers . In this function, I am starting a five year, Brussels based, program to foster 'smart leadership' in business, politics and academia, through the dissemination of complexity based decision taking processes. A first milestone has been the Brussels conference ""Complexity: Friend or Foe?"". in December 2009, at which Geoffrey West from Santa Fe was the keynote speaker. More info and some Youtube video clips can be found here.

Right now I am preparing the launch of a new company that will steer, manage and execute the ""complexity program"" in the coming years. Initial projects will study complex phenomena such as obesity in Asia, adoption of smart textiles, strategy formulation and business performance in industrial organizations. Additionally we will launch a series of complexity and systems thinking based education programs for decision takers and managers, and we will work together with Belgian education institutes to disseminate insights from complexity science to students. Furthermore we aim to set-up a virtual platform to bring complexity specialists into contact with owners of complex problems, in order to develop relevant solution scenario's. Finally we want to measure ""complexity adoption"" of leaders and decision takers in Belgium and Europe.

simple random walk dynamics. Inspired by the well-known relation between
 number of steps and mean squared distance in pure diffusive process, we
 studied diffusion over complex networks, using several models of 
networks: random, small-world, scale-free and geographical. Because the 
rate at which the process reaches larger distances is also of interest, 
we additionally studied the spreading rate, which is simply a measure of
 the random walker efficiency to spread away from the node that started 
the process. Our results thus far show that many important features of 
the network topology are displayed by these measures. The results to

Network's shortest paths,"Consider a random network consisting of N nodes where each pair of nodes is connected with a given probability p (see Erdos-Renyi random graph).
 The question is about the shortest path through the network from one 
node to another (also called geodesic path, or intervertex distance):
Can we calculate analytically (and exactly) the probability 
distribution of shortest paths in such a network? That is, how likely it
 is that a pair of nodes chosen at random will be distance D apart. For distance D=1 the answer is obviously p. What are such probabilities for distances D=2, D=3, D=4, etc.?
Note that the network has a finite number of nodes (which is not necessarily large) and there are only 2 parameters here, N and p.
This is a simple yet fundamental question and there is much more to 
follow in terms of immediate applications and new theories once we 
answer it.

node to another (also called geodesic path, or intervertex distance):
Can we calculate analytically (and exactly) the probability 
distribution of shortest paths in such a network? That is, how likely it
 is that a pair of nodes chosen at random will be distance D apart. For distance D=1 the answer is obviously p. What are such probabilities for distances D=2, D=3, D=4, etc.?
Note that the network has a finite number of nodes (which is not necessarily large) and there are only 2 parameters here, N and p.
This is a simple yet fundamental question and there is much more to 
follow in terms of immediate applications and new theories once we 
answer it.
",Network Science,Computing,4,Roberta Sinatra,Physics,Physical Sciences," Hi! I'm a second year PhD student in Physics, at ATP group of University of Catania (Italy), my advisor being Prof. Vito Latora.
 Since I started my MSc in Physics, I have always been fascinated by 
statistical mechanics, nonlinear dynamics and complex systems. In 
particular, connections with other disciplines like biology, economy and
 social sciences have captured my attention. For my MSc thesis I worked 
on statistical methods to convert sequences of symbols into networks, 
and I applied them to proteins. Afterwards, I have started focusing my 
interests on the study of structure, functions and evolution of complex 
networks, from both theoretical and empirical points of view. Before 
starting my PhD, I have spent some months at BIFI,
 University of Zaragoza (Spain), where I worked on Evolutionary Game 
Theory, studying the evolution of fairness by means of an the Ultimatum 
Game played on graphs, and at the School of Mathematical Sciences
 of Queen Mary College (London, UK), where I focused on entropy rate in 
Markov chains and on coupled ""man-made"" networks. Currently, for my PhD 
thesis, I am working on diffusion processes on graphs, in particular on 
biased random walks and on the influence of graph structure on dynamical
 processes. Part of this project is developed in collaboration with Prof. H.J. Jensen of the Institute for  Mathematical Sciences of the Imperial College (London), and with Prof. J. Gomez-Gardenes of the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (Madrid).
I dedicate some of my time also to a ""side"" project concerning 
neuroscience: I study the topological properties of connectivity 
patterns derived by EEG measurements in humans performing different 
tasks. I work on this last project in collaboration with Fondazione Santa Lucia, Roma.
In my spare time, I like traveling, reading, ""discovering"" old 
movies, cooking and making gastronomic experiments, playing volleyball, 
learning foreign languages, ...

Diffusion at the Boundary: Measures to Characterize the Diffusion Process in Complex Networks,"Many propagation processes on networks can be explained by assuming a 
simple random walk dynamics. Inspired by the well-known relation between
 number of steps and mean squared distance in pure diffusive process, we
 studied diffusion over complex networks, using several models of 
networks: random, small-world, scale-free and geographical. Because the 
rate at which the process reaches larger distances is also of interest, 
we additionally studied the spreading rate, which is simply a measure of
 the random walker efficiency to spread away from the node that started 
the process. Our results thus far show that many important features of 
the network topology are displayed by these measures. The results to 
come involve the scaling of these measures with network size and 
density.

I have graduated from the University of Gdansk (Poland) in 1997, where I was involved in a number of projects on bacterial and viral molecular genetics. I have then spent a year as a Fulbright Visiting Researcher in the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego, CA (where I worked on gene therapy in the brain using AAV vectors). After that, I went back to Poland to defend my PhD thesis in molecular genetics at the University of Gdansk. Two months later, I started my first postdoc at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (Israel), again in the hope of developing ways to do gene therapy in the brain. After I gave up learning Hebrew for hopeless (hey, I can still say 'hello!'...and... that's about it) I suddenly started to have lots of free time between the experiments. So I brushed up on my programming skills and did some bioinformatics on the side... This has got me so hooked up that for the next postdoc I went to Valencia), Spain) (at least I was consistent with climatic zones) to work on molecular evolution of HCV at the Cavanilles Institute. Valencia is a great city for skating and this skill was crucial when going from one campus to another, because I decided to attend classes in computer science and maths at the University of Valencia. My work on phylogenetics continued after I returned to Poland to work at the Institute of Oceanology, but again slowly the main focus of my research shifted. The main main research interest now is to develop a biologically realistic artificial life model to study the evolution of complexity at various levels: the level of the gene regulating network that governs the behavior of single cells (evolution of GRNs), the level of multicellular bodies (co-evolution of mind and body) and the level of communities of organisms (evolution of communication and co-operation in a multi-agent system).",,Male,Student,University of Gdansk,Germany,Unlisted,2010,Santa Fe,Dakota,

Evolutionary dynamics of fitness driven walkers on a graph,"The availability of empirical data on {humans and animal mobility has 
had a crucial impact on many dynamical processes found in both nature 
and society}. Here we take a closer look at the influences of both 
mobility and non-trivial network architecture on how interactions among 
individuals progress. Conventional models that involve spatial games are
 limited to representing players as nodes in the network with 
interactions steered by the linkages to other nodes, apart from the game
 rules. In this work, instead of using nodes to represent individual 
agents, we use the nodes to represent communities where players are 
situated. Two general processes are involved in this study namely,  the 
inter-node and intra-node dynamics, where each is described by its own 
spatio-temporal scale. Inside the nodes, individual players evolve under
 the context of the Ultimatum Game. This paradigm provides a measure, 
which is the average fitness of individuals inside a node, that can be 
interpreted as a mechanistic drive behind the mobility of agents on a 
network.

Local and nonlocal information in a traffic network: how important is the horizon?,"Recent advances in distributed sensor network technology have changed
 the landscape of traffic optimization in which small, mobile devices 
are able to sense local information and communicate in real time with 
one another.  Naive optimization algorithms that operate solely on the 
local or global level are inherently flawed, as global optimization 
requires every local sensor to communicate with a centralized 
base-station, creating prohibitive bandwidth, robustness, and security 
concerns, while local optimization methods are limited by a near 
information horizon as they are unable to propagate or react to 
information beyond their immediate vicinity.  This paper investigates an
 intermediate approach where individual sensors are able to propagate 
congestion information over a variable distance that is determined in 
real-time.  This strategy consistently out-performs a naive strategy 
where every car simply takes the shortest path to its destination, but 
does worse than a simpler optimization algorithm that only incorporates 
local information.  This is most likely because the intermediate 
solution directs cars along the same alternate path when attempting to 
free a congested area, thus creating new congestion along the detour. 
The results suggest that local information might set an upper bound on 
performance in models of cascading information.  Further work is 
required to confirm this observation and develop an algorithm able to 
join both local and global information to effectively diffuse traffic 
around congestion. 
",Engineering,Engineering and engineering trades,6,Giovanni Petri,"Engineering, Mathematics",Engineering and engineering trades;Mathematics and statistics,"Hello there, 
formalities first: I am Giovanni Petri, PhD student at the Centre for Transport Studies and the Complexity and Networks group at Imperial College London, my advisors being Prof. J. W. Polak on the engineering side and Prof. H. J. Jensen on the math one. 
You can drop me a Terry Pratchett quote at  gpetri@imperial.ac.uk or click here for the ugly site, or  here for my (slightly better) homepage;
 my  battle with wordpress  for graphic supremacy is ongoing: the site 
is in the making and soonish there might be something resembling a list 
of projects. 
Chit chat now: 
I've always been fascinated by shapes, pattern and regularities, 
belonging to math, the real world or even just ways of thinking. So I 
ended up studying physics to (try and) make sense of all that. I 
completed my MSc in Theoretical Physics with a  thesis about primordial 
structure formation during Inflation, basically the Universe's wrinkles.
 As I was going through it turned out that what thrilled me had a lot in
 common with many issues in complex systems, statistical mechanics and 
the such. 
Making a long story short, I am working on the interfacing of 
information and transportation networks. It looks a long way to go from 
cosmology but -in truth- it’s not. The goal of identifying and 
characterizing extremely non-trivial and involved spatio-temporal 
patterns in a changing space from simple rules can be applied to both 
fields equally well.
Consider, for instance, a model of a traffic network, where cars 
circulate, coupled to an information network, where information 
diffuses. The population on a node influences the        informational state of
 the corresponding node in the information layer. The latter modifies 
the rules by which the cars go around.
What is happening is that you have a bunch of particles changing the 
landscape they are moving in, while the landscape defines where they are
 going to move next. Beyond the technicalities, the picture is not very 
different from early universe particles moving around according to a 
metric, that they contribute to modify as they move.
And if you find some self-organization, then that becomes VERY exciting!
  
Going back to the mundane, I live of short, very strong 
obsessions and these over the years encompassed basketball, tennis, 
squash, football, guitar (still trying, still failing), reading (lots!),
 trekking, video games (Eve Online for the converts), parkour and 
Capoeira. 
The last one, having lasted for quite a while now, is the exception that
 confirms the rule. Also, since there are so many climbers I wouldn't 
mind getting a crash course. No, wait, bad phrasing...
With languages I am slightly better than the average Italian, 
meaning that I can communicate in English, snore in French, had some 
pretty unsettling ""lost in translation"" experiences in German and sing 
(badly) in (poor) Portuguese.  
Oh and in London I'm trying to pick up  British accent and 
self-deprecating humor.

I have graduated from the University of Gdansk (Poland) in 1997, where I was involved in a number of projects on bacterial and viral molecular genetics. I have then spent a year as a Fulbright Visiting Researcher in the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego, CA (where I worked on gene therapy in the brain using AAV vectors). After that, I went back to Poland to defend my PhD thesis in molecular genetics at the University of Gdansk. Two months later, I started my first postdoc at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (Israel), again in the hope of developing ways to do gene therapy in the brain. After I gave up learning Hebrew for hopeless (hey, I can still say 'hello!'...and... that's about it) I suddenly started to have lots of free time between the experiments. So I brushed up on my programming skills and did some bioinformatics on the side... This has got me so hooked up that for the next postdoc I went to Valencia), Spain) (at least I was consistent with climatic zones) to work on molecular evolution of HCV at the Cavanilles Institute. Valencia is a great city for skating and this skill was crucial when going from one campus to another, because I decided to attend classes in computer science and maths at the University of Valencia. My work on phylogenetics continued after I returned to Poland to work at the Institute of Oceanology, but again slowly the main focus of my research shifted. The main main research interest now is to develop a biologically realistic artificial life model to study the evolution of complexity at various levels: the level of the gene regulating network that governs the behavior of single cells (evolution of GRNs), the level of multicellular bodies (co-evolution of mind and body) and the level of communities of organisms (evolution of communication and co-operation in a multi-agent system).",,Male,Student,University of Gdansk,Germany,Unlisted,2010,Santa Fe,Dakota,

",Linguistics,Humanities,5,Giovanni Petri,"Engineering, Mathematics",Engineering and engineering trades;Mathematics and statistics,"Hello there, 
formalities first: I am Giovanni Petri, PhD student at the Centre for Transport Studies and the Complexity and Networks group at Imperial College London, my advisors being Prof. J. W. Polak on the engineering side and Prof. H. J. Jensen on the math one. 
You can drop me a Terry Pratchett quote at  gpetri@imperial.ac.uk or click here for the ugly site, or  here for my (slightly better) homepage;
 my  battle with wordpress  for graphic supremacy is ongoing: the site 
is in the making and soonish there might be something resembling a list 
of projects. 
Chit chat now: 
I've always been fascinated by shapes, pattern and regularities, 
belonging to math, the real world or even just ways of thinking. So I 
ended up studying physics to (try and) make sense of all that. I 
completed my MSc in Theoretical Physics with a  thesis about primordial 
structure formation during Inflation, basically the Universe's wrinkles.
 As I was going through it turned out that what thrilled me had a lot in
 common with many issues in complex systems, statistical mechanics and 
the such. 
Making a long story short, I am working on the interfacing of 
information and transportation networks. It looks a long way to go from 
cosmology but -in truth- it’s not. The goal of identifying and 
characterizing extremely non-trivial and involved spatio-temporal 
patterns in a changing space from simple rules can be applied to both 
fields equally well.
Consider, for instance, a model of a traffic network, where cars 
circulate, coupled to an information network, where information 
diffuses. The population on a node influences the        informational state of
 the corresponding node in the information layer. The latter modifies 
the rules by which the cars go around.
What is happening is that you have a bunch of particles changing the 
landscape they are moving in, while the landscape defines where they are
 going to move next. Beyond the technicalities, the picture is not very 
different from early universe particles moving around according to a 
metric, that they contribute to modify as they move.
And if you find some self-organization, then that becomes VERY exciting!
  
Going back to the mundane, I live of short, very strong 
obsessions and these over the years encompassed basketball, tennis, 
squash, football, guitar (still trying, still failing), reading (lots!),
 trekking, video games (Eve Online for the converts), parkour and 
Capoeira. 
The last one, having lasted for quite a while now, is the exception that
 confirms the rule. Also, since there are so many climbers I wouldn't 
mind getting a crash course. No, wait, bad phrasing...
With languages I am slightly better than the average Italian, 
meaning that I can communicate in English, snore in French, had some 
pretty unsettling ""lost in translation"" experiences in German and sing 
(badly) in (poor) Portuguese.  
Oh and in London I'm trying to pick up  British accent and 
self-deprecating humor.

Populations are shaped by the spatial structure of their

(sub)populations). The topology of structures at both levels can have a 
profound influence on the evolutionary dynamics of a population. Here, 
we present a simple computational model in which genetic algorithms 
evolve cellular automaton rules to perform a classification task with 
which we investigate the evolutionary dynamics of (meta)populations

several distinct contact structures. We find that contact structures -- 
modeled as graphs with various topologies -- that limit the number of 
breeding partners show a higher evolvability and produce individuals 
with a higher fitness than populations with contact structures in which 
individuals have a high number of possible partners. Furthermore, we 
show that well-mixed populations greatly benefit from being subdivided

well-mixed contact structures can attain a fitness comparable to

The Coevolution of Residential and Friendship Networks: An Extension of the Schelling Model,"During the past few decades social network analysis has produced a great
 deal of insight into the workings of social systems. While social 
scientists have put a lot of work into the investigation of residential,
 friendship, trust, exchange or discussion networks, scientific inquiry 
has typically limited itself to investigating the characteristics of 
networks of only one kind. This approach has produced plentiful insight 
on the structure and function of different kinds of social networks, but
 the interaction between the different kinds of social networks has 
received insufficient investigation so far. Our work, in which we 
examine the interaction of residential and social networks represents an
 attempt at advancing this field of inquiry. More specifically, we 
extend a classic model of residential segregation (Schelling, 1968) by 
incorporating a social network that constructs -- and is influenced by 
-- residential preferences. We use Agent-Based Modelling to examine how 
social network topology affects residential segregation in the Schelling
 model. Given its current popularity in social simulation, extending the
 Schelling model is an important task in its own right, but we seek to 
achieve something more fundamental than a mere rehashing of an old 
model. We deploy Schelling's model as the basis for a way to understand 
multiplex networks, and seek to give a formal, methodologically 
practicable expression to Granovetter's concept of embeddedness.

formalities first: I am Giovanni Petri, PhD student at the Centre for Transport Studies and the Complexity and Networks group at Imperial College London, my advisors being Prof. J. W. Polak on the engineering side and Prof. H. J. Jensen on the math one. 
You can drop me a Terry Pratchett quote at  gpetri@imperial.ac.uk or click here for the ugly site, or  here for my (slightly better) homepage;
 my  battle with wordpress  for graphic supremacy is ongoing: the site 
is in the making and soonish there might be something resembling a list 
of projects. 
Chit chat now: 
I've always been fascinated by shapes, pattern and regularities, 
belonging to math, the real world or even just ways of thinking. So I 
ended up studying physics to (try and) make sense of all that. I 
completed my MSc in Theoretical Physics with a  thesis about primordial 
structure formation during Inflation, basically the Universe's wrinkles.
 As I was going through it turned out that what thrilled me had a lot in
 common with many issues in complex systems, statistical mechanics and 
the such. 
Making a long story short, I am working on the interfacing of 
information and transportation networks. It looks a long way to go from 
cosmology but -in truth- it’s not. The goal of identifying and 
characterizing extremely non-trivial and involved spatio-temporal 
patterns in a changing space from simple rules can be applied to both 
fields equally well.
Consider, for instance, a model of a traffic network, where cars 
circulate, coupled to an information network, where information 
diffuses. The population on a node influences the        informational state of
 the corresponding node in the information layer. The latter modifies 
the rules by which the cars go around.
What is happening is that you have a bunch of particles changing the 
landscape they are moving in, while the landscape defines where they are
 going to move next. Beyond the technicalities, the picture is not very 
different from early universe particles moving around according to a 
metric, that they contribute to modify as they move.
And if you find some self-organization, then that becomes VERY exciting!
  
Going back to the mundane, I live of short, very strong 
obsessions and these over the years encompassed basketball, tennis, 
squash, football, guitar (still trying, still failing), reading (lots!),
 trekking, video games (Eve Online for the converts), parkour and 
Capoeira. 
The last one, having lasted for quite a while now, is the exception that
 confirms the rule. Also, since there are so many climbers I wouldn't 
mind getting a crash course. No, wait, bad phrasing...
With languages I am slightly better than the average Italian, 
meaning that I can communicate in English, snore in French, had some 
pretty unsettling ""lost in translation"" experiences in German and sing 
(badly) in (poor) Portuguese.  
Oh and in London I'm trying to pick up  British accent and 
self-deprecating humor.

scientists have put a lot of work into the investigation of residential,
 friendship, trust, exchange or discussion networks, scientific inquiry 
has typically limited itself to investigating the characteristics of 
networks of only one kind. This approach has produced plentiful insight 
on the structure and function of different kinds of social networks, but
 the interaction between the different kinds of social networks has 
received insufficient investigation so far. Our work, in which we 
examine the interaction of residential and social networks represents an
 attempt at advancing this field of inquiry. More specifically, we 
extend a classic model of residential segregation (Schelling, 1968) by 
incorporating a social network that constructs -- and is influenced by 
-- residential preferences. We use Agent-Based Modelling to examine how 
social network topology affects residential segregation in the Schelling
 model. Given its current popularity in social simulation, extending the
 Schelling model is an important task in its own right, but we seek to 
achieve something more fundamental than a mere rehashing of an old 
model. We deploy Schelling's model as the basis for a way to understand 
multiplex networks, and seek to give a formal, methodologically 
practicable expression to Granovetter's concept of embeddedness.

Applying clustering algorithms on the dataset from a blog website of 370,000 posts from 2,275 blogs, we identified two types of bloggers: specialists and generalists. Then we compared their respective contributions to the blogosphere in terms of productivity and buzz-factor. Our analysis suggests that specialists generally have a higher impact than generalists.

Human Mobility in an Online World,"Massive multiplayer online games provide a fascinating new way of 
observing hundreds of thousands of simultaneously interacting 
individuals engaged in virtual socio-economic activities. We have 
compiled a data set consisting of practically all actions of all players
 over a period of three years from an online game played by over 350,000
 people. The universe of this online world is a network on which players
 move to interact with other players. This interaction may consist of 
trade, armed conflict, friendship and enmity. We focus on the mobility 
of human players on the network over a time-period of 500 days. We take a
 number of mobility measurements (daily and biweekly position changes, 
entropy, number of unique nodes visited) of players and compare them 
with measures of simulated random walkers on the same topology. Player 
mobility is highly different from the mobility of unbiased random 
walkers. The analysis of biased random walkers reveals the two essential
 ingredients which explain measured human mobility patterns most 
accurately: heterogeneity and a tendency to return to recently visited 
locations. We compare our entropy distributions with human mobility in 
real life world -- measured via mobile phone data -- and find a striking
 match.

,,,,,Victor Quintanar-Zilinskas,"Complex Biological Systems
",Life sciences,"Victor Quintanar-Zilinskas is a graduate student at the University of California, Irvine.  His current research focus,  linked with the experimental results of his collaborators Xiangmin Xu, Ron Frostig, and Raju Metherate, is system-level dynamics and information processing in many-neuron (on the order of 1000s) networks.  His advisors are Zoran Nenadic and SFI faculty member Arthur Lander.
Over the next five years, Victor intends to turn the focus of his
 network modeling to the study of 1) the information-processing 
consequences of the brain's frequent brief episodes of self-organized 
synchrony between groups of neurons 2) the potential for cognitive 
utilization of information generated by complex dynamics (Turing 
patterns are an illustration of such generation); what he will learn 
this summer at SFI
 (from both modules and peers) will be highly applicable to the pursuit 
of these topics.  The latter topic is particularly difficult to study, 
but information-generative modeling and olfactory computation results are likely starting points of reference.
Victor was raised in Palo Alto, CA and his interests and outlooks are heavily influenced by his upbringing in Silicon Valley's technoculture.  He double-majored in math and biology at Santa Clara University
 (class of 2009), where he did his first computational neuroscience 
research, sparking his current interests.  He also worked with Geoffrey Bowker (who was, at the time, at Santa Clara University)
 to characterize the work practices of scholar communities that study 
complex systems (e.g. networks of ecologists that study various facets 
of the same ecosystem); it was while on this project that he developed 
his appreciation for the study of black swan emergence events (e.g. 
shifts between stable states of the composition of an ocean bacteria 
population; large storms).  Victor's current ""applied philosophy"" 
interest is the connections between Constructivism, creativity theory, and interdisciplinarity.

methods of risk analysis related to climate change and some dabbling in 
development economics and the history of economic thought.

 Australia.  My thesis seeks to understand behaviour (principally 
performance and resilience) in coupled human-engineered systems.  I 
contend that a lack of understanding about the interactions between 
these systems is a major barrier to sustainability implementation in the
 industrial sector.  My research context is water management within the 
minerals industry.  I'm adopting a systems modelling approach to study 
engineered systems, combined with social network analysis to look at 
human systems.  Building on Ashby’s law of requisite variety, I 
hypothesise that performance of the coupled system will be best when 
human and engineered systems are aligned according to their complexity. 
 I will test this hypothesis through gathering empirical data from case 
study sites.  
I’m supervised cross-faculty by Prof Chris Moran at the 
Sustainable Minerals Institute and Dr Tim Kastelle at the UQ Business 
School.  My own background is in Chemical Engineering/Business 
Management.  
What expertise can I bring to the group?   It looks like 
I'm the only Australian in the group, so I shall bring with me different
 experiences and perspectives.  In particular, I’ve had a lot of 
practical experience working at a number of industrial sites (during and
 post my undergrad degree) including a copper mine, alumina refinery, 
paper mill, oil refinery, and an ammonia/urea plant.  I have a solid 
understanding of sustainability and the practical challenges associated 
with its implementation in the industrial sector.  I look forward to 
some engaging in some insightful discussions with others who have 
interests in this field. 
Through my PhD I'm developing a good understanding of the various
 statistical models available to analyse social network data.  The 
programs I've been using so far are UCINET and Netdraw, and I intend to 
use PNet down the track to investigate the factors driving network 
evolution.   
What do I hope to get out of CSSS?     I'm excited about 
all of the modules!  I’m particularly eager to learn about structure and
 dynamics across multi-scale networks and to advance my understanding of
 network emergence, resilience and robustness.  I also look forward to 
exploring approaches to conceptualize (and hopefully measure!) 
complexity in an empirical context, and to learn about novel approaches 
for validating models of complex systems. 
Possible projects  I'll have a think about this...  But it
 could be interesting to do a project investigating sustainability 
challenges across different political and/or industrial regions, drawing
 on the diversity of scholars' experiences.  Perhaps an investigation 
into the challenges of meeting multi-objectives across diverse 
industrial, governance and societal systems?

Space of complex networks and robustness,,Network Analysis,Computing,4,Marco Antonio Duenas Esterling,Economics,Social and behavioural science,"I'm a 4th year PhD student in Economics at Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies in Pisa-Italy. My research is related to Trade Networks and Economic Growth. I have a degree in physics, I worked on quantum gates using cold atoms, that was a fantastic theoretical work. Then something happened and I decided to do a MA in Economics, the thesis was related to spatial prisoners dilemma.

To give you an idea about my PhD thesis I investigate whether the gravity model employed in international trade theory can explain the statistical properties of the International Trade Network. The idea is to estimate with econometrics methods the trade flows among countries, or the weights of the links, and then see if these estimations are equivalent to what it is observed in the real network. It can sound strange a ""gravity model in economics"", but the idea actually works quite nice, the term ""gravity"" comes about because the predicted relation between trade flows and explanatory variables is similar to Newton's formula: the magnitude of aggregated trade flows between a pair of countries is proportional to the product of country sizes (e.g. the masses, as proxied by country GDPs) and inversely proportional to their geographic distance (interpreted as proxies of trade-resistance factors, e.g. tariffs).

Look that this notion of gravity in social sciences can be adapted to many systems, e.g. migrations, describe how consumers flow between different shopping malls, patients between hospitals... I would be very happy to help interested people in econometric techniques related with the gravity like model, it is connected to Poisson models in count data analysis and Logistic regressions... So if you have the data we could start now to think a project.

One of the conclusions of my research is that the gravity model in trade successfully replicates some weighted-network structure of the trade network, but only if one fixes its binary architecture equal to the observed one. Conversely, the gravity approach performs very badly when asked to predict the presence of a link, or the level of the trade flow it carries, whenever the binary structure must be simultaneously estimated. Hence, one topic I'm very interested is in network formation.

On the side of economic growth I did an empirical analysis of cross sectional GDP business cycles. Business cycles are obtained after applying filtering techniques to country time series, and the cycle is sometimes used in economic literature as white noise that characterize economic fluctuations and volatility. The probability density functions of those cycles show fat-tails, and the volatilities are characterized by an inverse power law relation with the country size. The conclusion is that heterogeneity in economic systems survives to many frequency levels, in other words independently of the filter you can apply there is something that remains, so is the cycle white noise?",Italian,Male,Student,Sant'Anna School for Advanced Studies,Italy,Unlisted,2012,Santa Fe,Kyle,

"The Robustness, Stability and Persistence of Niche-Structured Food Webs",,Network Analysis,Computing;Life sciences,4,Miguel Lurgi,Computer Science,Computing,"My main research interests are focused on: (i) the understanding of the mechanisms behind the emergence of structure in ecological networks of different kinds, primarily food webs, plant-pollinator and host-symbiont networks; (ii) the study of the assembly and disassembly dynamics of ecological networks, particularly how relevant is evolution and the emergence of novelty for these processes; and (iii) the stability of this kind of networks, how to measure it and how this stability is related to the network structure and dynamics. All this in the context of environmental change and how different components of this change (e.g. climate change, habitat loss, species invasions) affect the structure of the interactions network and ultimately the dynamics of the system and the species populations, and the ecosystem functioning.

From a theoretical perspective I tackle these problems through an individual (agent) based, spatially explicit simulation approach. Because evolutionary change occurs at the level of the individual, this scale is relevant for the kind of problems mentioned above; also, interactions in real ecosystem ultimately happen at the individual level and the spatial scale is important when looking at the actual occurrence of these interactions.

I have also applied complex networks techniques for the analysis of empirically obtained interaction networks to look at the changes of their structure due to climate change.

Expertise
As a computer scientist I have worked mainly in the development of multi-agent based systems and have also some experience in other computational techniques such as genetic algorithms and neural networks. My most recent research in the area of AI was the development of an ecologically inspired technique for the engineering of intelligent agent based systems.

My research is basically related to mathematical epidemiology. More specifically, I am currently interested in the interplay between the evolution of transmissible diseases and population's contact structures. That is, how disease traits, such as virulence, evolve in response to the topological properties of the social network, and how, in turn, the disease dynamics influences the adaptive behaviors of the agents/nodes in the network and hence its topology. This, in a sense, is a broad research question, thus it can be framed or contextualized in many ways; ways that I am more than happy to talk about, explore and expand during my time at this CSSS. Finding answers to questions of this kind could be relevant to major public health issues such as the evolution of microbial drug resistance, the emergence of new diseases and vaccine designs.

One short story is that I'm interested in evolution, network science, mathematics, computer science, and language. A longer story is that in light of an internal struggle that I believe has explicitly confronted thinkers, at the least since Kant, my approach to research teeters about the fulcrum between rationalism and empiricism with respect to the order in which each is applied in attempts to cultivate knowledge. My scientific research interests began with synthetic biology and the study of bacterial quorum sensing and broadened from there to include systems biology and the evolution of multicellularity.

I am interested in all aspects of mathematical modeling of social and economic systems. I graduated from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology where I got BSc and MSc in applied mathematics and physics. This spring I defended a Candidate of Physico-mathematical sciences degree (analog of PhD). My thesis title was ""Application of sufficient optimality conditions to analysis of dynamic stochastic models of trade in the markets with illiquid assets"". Shortly, first part of the thesis was about a portfolio problem where rebalancing may occur only at random moments of time, an extension of Grossman-Laroque model. The second part was about the equilibrium of the market for agents acting like in the first part of the thesis, and an integro-differential equation for the equilibrium price. Pure art and challenge. The third is about a variation of Kiyotaki-Wright search model of exchange where there is a finite number of agents. At the same time I got a MA in economics from New Economic School. NES has a group of strong mathematicians who teach optimization, microeconomics and game theory. At NES I was doing research in network games and coalitions. After graduation I started teaching microeconomics at HSE. Now I am a researcher at Computing Centre of Russian Academy of Science and only started looking for new theme for research. I also continue to work on inter-temporal equilibrium models in macroeconomic analysis. I am here for new ideas and tools for research. Especially eager to learn computational methods such as simulation and agent-based modelling. After several years of analysing steady and limiting states, infinite-horizon problems and stationary equilibria it is time to look what transition states look like.

I studied mathematics (with philosophy as a minor) in Heidelberg, Santiago de Chile and Berlin, then analyzed exchange rates at the Inter-American Development Bank and tried to model air quality within a project on megacities of the German Helmholtz Association for a little bit, before enganging in my PhD research at the Courant Research Center ""Poverty, Equity and Growth in Developing Countries"" at Goettingen University. I am interested in all kinds of questions related to a sustainable development of the world, in particular understanding extreme poverty, the factors driving it, what we can do about it, global justice and our responsibility for suffering in faraway places. My specific area of research is price transmission analysis. It looks at how price shocks are transmitted between various markets in different locations or between the world market and domestic markets, that is, for example, in which way recent price peaks for wheat or rice on the world market have affected people in developing countries. The current workhorse in this field is a type of time series model called threshold vector error correction model. The reasoning behind it is very intuitive when considering a pair of two markets, but -- at least to my mind -- does not appear appropriate when really these two markets form part of a larger network. Searching for a different set of tools to handle this extended setting is what got me interested in complex systems. This is completely new territory for me and I hope that during the course of this summer school I will be able to gain some understanding of this area of research and its potential applicability to price transmission analysis.

I would love to meet and work with others who are interested in how computational methods and complex systems can (1) be partnered with qualitative methods, such as participant observation, interview, archival analysis, and case study, (2) shed light on social mechanisms, especially the connections between the economic, cultural, and political, and (3) further social justice and innovation.

I'm interested in how organizations strategize and navigate socio-political institutions, especially within hostile political environments. I'm particularly interested in organizations that change policies, which address the structural roots of urban inequality and build more resilient communities.

In our increasingly privatized state, public policies are not simply implemented by state actors, but are materialized in coordination with private entrepreneurs. These actors must navigate not only economic but also cultural and political realms. I explore how they do so effectively (or ineffectively) and what implications their actions have for public policy as it happens on the ground. To examine these actors and their impacts, I connect micro-level analyses of these organizations with their strategies on political fields.

For my current project, I examine how social benefit corporations, such as nonprofits that develop affordable housing, navigate urban redevelopment politics and innovate their strategies. These actors understand and respond to changing demographic and increasingly hostile contexts.

One is the development of economic, political, and environmental games as critical research methods that promote players to reflect on their decisions and the development of norms, institutions, and sustainability. Key aspects in the development of these games have included offering alternatives to standard game theorietic assumptions of player rationality and finding ways to balance player motivations in ways that are neither purely cooperative nor purely competitive, leaving players with situations that feel less contrived and more like real life than most games. These games are systemic in nature, and players' choices have consequential effects on the system.

Using Habermas' theory of knowledge to understanding validity, bias, and reliability in research practice, this work suggests alternatives to positivist and post-positivist conceptions are, when dealing with normative issues, both desirable and necessary.

What sort of expertise can you bring to the group?

I've spent most of the past decade killing my heroes---thinking critically about exciting ideas in complex systems. I apply complex systems concepts to social systems using experiments in human collective behavior.
My background is in cognitive science. Undergrad was cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience, with a special affection for cognitive linguistics. Grad has been about group and collective behavior: experiments and modeling.
I worked two years for Yaneer Bar-Yam at the New England Complex Systems Institute in Cambridge, MA
I have lots of side projects: I'm publishing in the strange new field applying empirical methods to the study of classic literature, like Shakespeare
I have lots of side projects: I've dabbled with RBN's, network dynamics, and community structure
I have lots of side projects: I have a project on reciprocity in the NBA
I have lots of side projects: I'm interested in Institutional Analysis, a funny branch of political science that includes economics, anthro, sociology, psychology, and other disciplines. I have applied it to the niche world of cooperative businesses.

FCV are one possible technology that could be very useful in tackling CO2 emissions and air pollution in the transport sector as they convert hydrogen fuel to electricity directly rather than combusting fossil fuels, emitting only water. Whilst they have a number of challenges to overcome, I was looking at how to replace the expensive platinum electrocatalyst which is currently an essential component.

I have previously received a BSc Physics from the University of Durham, UK, and an MPhil in Engineering for Sustainable Development, also at the University of Cambridge.

I'm currently a postdoc fellow at the Paleontological Institute and Museum of the Univ. of Zurich, Switzerland (PIMUZ).

My main interest is in the coupled histories of Earth and life on various spatial and time scales. My recent research experience includes the integrative use of paleontological, geochemical and sedimentological data in order to study the mechanisms that led to the greatest mass extinction of the Phanerozoic at the Permo-Triassic boundary (about 250 Ma).

During my PhD in paleontology I became an expert on conodonts, which were eel-shaped, marine animals. Their tooth-like phosphatic elements represent the earliest expression of a mineralized skeleton among vertebrates. These conodont elements are important index fossils from the Cambrian to the end of the Triassic. As such, not only they provide an interesting tool for evolutionary studies, but they also enable to construct timescales against which geological and biological events can be calibrated. Moreover, their chemical composition has remained relatively stable and hence they record past changes in the temperature and composition of oceans.

Some of my last results include a 3d reconstruction of their oro-pharyngeal apparatus at work (movie). In the near future I plan to use functional analysis of these ‘teeth’ to infer the potential location of different conodont taxa within past food webs and to study changes of these food webs’ topology in relation with evolutionary events (innovations, radiations, crisis). Because the morphology of these ‘teeth’ obviously do not reflect only functional purposes but also important developmental aspects (which are potentially common to extant vertebrates), another project that I’m currently preparing deals with the morphogenesis of these tooth-like elements.

During the last years I have devoted most of my efforts to the production and analysis of empirical data. In the near future I plan to focus on the development of data-driven theoretical models. In most of these projects, I have to deal with complex systems. Though my training as a physicist included some of the required tools, I feel that I might need an update on some of the topics addressed during the CSSS. My main motivation for attending (and actively participating in ;) ) the CSSS is to have the chance to meet the experts on these topics and hence get a current overview over potentials and limitations of complex systems research.

Project Interests
My research is basically related to mathematical epidemiology. More specifically, I am currently interested in the interplay between the evolution of transmissible diseases and population's contact structures. That is, how disease traits, such as virulence, evolve in response to the topological properties of the social network, and how, in turn, the disease dynamics influences the adaptive behaviors of the agents/nodes in the network and hence its topology. This, in a sense, is a broad research question, thus it can be framed or contextualized in many ways; ways that I am more than happy to talk about, explore and expand during my time at this CSSS. Finding answers to questions of this kind could be relevant to major public health issues such as the evolution of microbial drug resistance, the emergence of new diseases and vaccine designs.

NA2,,NA,,2,Xiaoli Dong,"Sustainability, Ecology",Environmental protection;Life sciencess,"I am a third year PhD student, working in fluvial landscapes, and am interested in spatial ecology.

As we walk along a stream or a river, we see different species are located in different places. Some sets of species colonize together to form a patch. Some patches have regular patterns while others do not and the geometry of patches may vary widely. Groups of patches are arrayed in space and water flow through and across them. Dissolved nutrients may be taken up or released and organisms can migrate from patch to patch.

Why are ecosystem components located where they are? Is the existing structure optimal for individual within it? How do we even define optimality? How does the spatial structure change over time? Is change directional? If so, what is the mechanism of directionality?

We are puzzled by what we see - the forms of landscapes - and we may contemplate the relationship between form and function. The form-function relationship is a classic concern in physiology and evolutionary biology; yet, the same question, asked at the level of an ecosystem, is stimulating: what is the relationship between landscape heterogeneity and its functioning? To be more specific: how is spatial heterogeneity formed, how does spatial heterogeneity influence ecosystem functioning, and how does ecosystem functioning feedback on spatial structures, if it does so at all? These are the major questions of my dissertation. I do both manipulative experiments in the field and simulation models to answer these questions.

While the amount of work that I can do for my degree is limited, the questions that I propose reach out to more fundamental ideas (1) form-function relationships in complex systems: In physiology, the relationship between form and function is clear: organs are the way they are because they are functional improvements generated by natural selection. However, the form-function relationship gets much more complicated in a complex system like a landscape-ecosystem, a hierarchical level where natural selection does not operate. Rather, self-organization may play an analogous role. This leads to another fundamental idea for ecosystems: (2) Natural selection (NS) vs. self-organization (SO): The definitions of the terms suggest that NS maximizes fitness whereas SO maximize the rate of energy/material flow. As an individual, an organism ""tries"" to maximize its survivorship and reproduction (e.g. to overcome water and nutrient limitation, etc.). As a group of interacting individuals, organisms are patterned into spatial structures. How are these individuals and collective forces reconciled? Does SO help increase fitness? My research endeavors to develop an integrated framework for ecosystems as complex adaptive systems. The broader theoretical foundation is rooted in the intersection of evolutionary theory and ecosystem ecology and in the intersection of community ecology and ecosystem ecology. I look forward to stimulating and challenging discussions on these topics.",Chinese,Female,Student,Arizona State University,United States,101-150,2012,Santa Fe,Kyle,
NA2,,NA,,2,Xue Feng,Sustainability,Environmental protection,"My project now revolves around the ""sustainability of seasonally dry ecosystems."" In more practical terms, I would like study how organisms and people cope (and thrive) in places where the supply of essential water resources (in the form of rainfall) is unpredictable both in terms of the amount and of its temporal distribution. This issue of unpredictability, or randomness in time, is manifested at multiple time scales--from the daily to the interannual--which all compound to the challenge of trying to maximize effective water use.

My latest project is in trying to quantify the level of rainfall seasonality in the tropics by decomposing time series.

Eventually I would like to look at how such rainfall variability, as a dominant ecological force, is propagated through different levels in the ecosystem. And whether a variety of coping strategies, both from nature (e.g., drought avoidance and deciduousness) and from human management (e.g., irrigation, fertilization), can help to stablize the ecosystem against unforeseen extreme events (e.g., fire, disease, catastrophic climate change). In other words, how does the diversity of responses contribute to the resilience of the ecosystem?

For modeling, I alternate between Mathematica, Matlab, and Python.

Before that, I did 2 years of a philosophy PhD program there, where I was interested in general philosophy of science and also philosophy of physics, particularly issues of emergence (classical dynamics from quantum, and the thermodynamic arrow of time from time-symmetric stat mech), and before that I got my undergraduate degree in Physics and Philosophy from Oxford (where, among other things, I did a project on the evolution of matter in the universe under various models of dark energy (!)). I won't go into the details of how I ended up shifting over to linguistics, but I'll just say a bit about my current interests. Broadly, I am interested in understanding why languages have the structures they do, both structure that is common to all languages (there is a lot less of this than one might think, but there are at least some very general commonalities) and those that seem to vary cross-linguistically. It seems to me that modeling language as a complex adaptive system is very apt, given the nature of language as an evolving system based in interactions between agents and constrained by many different factors (such as biology, cognitive abilities, information transmission pressures, and of course culture). Contrary to previous theories of language where most of the structure was thought to be due to some sort of innate language faculty, I want to explore to what extent it is possible to account for the structure and evolutionary behaviour of language by modelling it as a complex system, which depends on all the sorts of domain-general factors mentioned above, as well as domain-general learning mechanisms, such as statistical and analogical learning. I have a number of specific projects I'm just beginning to work on, but at the CSSS I'm mostly interested in gaining modelling tools that I can apply to building agent-based simulations of language learning and language evolution. From various conversations with people today, I thought I'd mention a few other things I am interested in and would love to talk more about over coffee or somesuch during the next few weeks: information theory, category theory, social networks, logic and philosophy, cognition, neural networks, and of course anything physics related. I am also deeply interested in art and music, and like to make a bit of both (as well as study patterns in them!).

Currently 2nd-year PhD student in Language Evolution at the University of Edinburgh

Interests: I'm interested in mapping out the evolutionary dynamics involved in cultural transmission systems. I also wonder whether general evolutionary frameworks for culture are possible, or if different transmission systems (ex: social network typology) or the cultural information that's being passed on (ex: language, music, religious beliefs) are too idiosyncratic to be lumped together and modeled generally.

Mainly, I research how the learning biases of individuals in a population map to the emergent structure of the language that they share - and look at how the transmission process itself modulates this. My master thesis addressed this problem with an iterated learning model of cultural transmission with Bayesian agents. Iterated learning models highlight language as a complex dynamic system that adapts to the environment which it propagates through; the environment here is the cognitive constraints of the humans (or agents) that learn and use the language. The main results we get for these types of models is that language becomes more learnable and structured via use.

I'd like to gain more tools to analyze these data sets with and as many outside perspectives on my work as possible.

Currently, I'm experimenting with human probability matching behavior and trying to formulate simple cognitive biases in terms of selection pressures in a culturally evolving systems. In particular, I'm searching for mechanisms and processes in social learning that can support the appearance of drift at the surface level of a culture: for example, counting up the number of different names that parents give their children each year is a surface level measure of cultural variation, where each variant is a baby name. And looking into the process by which parents actually choose their baby's name gives us a mechanistic understanding of how the variation we witness is generated.

Recent research is claiming that lots of cultural change over time just looks like drift. And generally, drift is something we try to formulate as a neutral model, which we would like to rule out to see if the change we witness is due to something more interesting then just sampling error - but to something like a selection pressure due to the functionality or fitness of one cultural variant over another. However, it is questionable whether true drift processes occur in cultural evolution: what could possibly be an ""uninteresting"" change that occurs for a system that must replicate by passing through human cognition? That's a great question...",,Female,Student,University of Edinburgh,United Kingdom,Top 50,2012,Santa Fe,Kyle,

Fractal cartography, cellular automata simulation, genetic algorithms and statistical physics are some of the theoretical components underlying a scientific framework of cities, utilizing technology and information. The science of cities incorporates a variety of frameworks—what Herbert Simon calls the ‘science of the artificial’—such as artificial life, agent based design, systems dynamics, information theory and data mining. With over half the world’s population living in cities and millions more moving to them every year, an understanding of growth and decay patterns in cities as organism-like systems within a broader context is intimately connected with meta-level processes such as global warming and developing long term sustainable and regenerative approaches to design.

Fractal cartography, cellular automata simulation, genetic algorithms and statistical physics are some of the theoretical components underlying a scientific framework of cities, utilizing technology and information. The science of cities incorporates a variety of frameworks—what Herbert Simon calls the ‘science of the artificial’—such as artificial life, agent based design, systems dynamics, information theory and data mining. With over half the world’s population living in cities and millions more moving to them every year, an understanding of growth and decay patterns in cities as organism-like systems within a broader context is intimately connected with meta-level processes such as global warming and developing long term sustainable and regenerative approaches to design.

Matrix Matters,,Mathematics,Mathematics and statistics,4,Kristen Honey,Ecology,Life sciences,"I am a broadly trained marine population and community ecologist⎯interested in understanding the interplay of species’ traits, environmental variability, and population and community dynamics⎯with unique experience in and a passion for synthesizing science and applying it to real-world policy and management challenges. I completed my Stanford University PhD in September 2012 with a dissertation entitled, “Aligning Complex, Adaptive Systems Theory and Data-Limited Assessment Strategies for Improved Fisheries Management.” During the completion of my Stanford PhD and the work that I performed during this period, I focused upon integrative fisheries management to bridge the gaps between regulators, scientists, and fishermen. This involved explicit consideration of optimal sampling designs and data collection protocols for long-term monitoring and evaluation of California’s network of marine protected areas. For years, I hoped to attend the Santa Fe Institute’s Complex Systems Summer School (CSSS) but was previously committed with PhD fieldwork and SCUBA diving to count fish each summer—until now! Today, I work for a private firm, Integrated Statistics, but my office is at NOAA headquarters in Silver Spring, MD. I work on NOAA’s Large Marine Ecosystems program, which is complex, adaptive systems and adaptive management in action!

As further motivation and enthusiasm for CSSS 2013, I am keenly interested in disease ecology. My interest stems from my own Lyme disease misdiagnosis and the ineffectiveness of conventional medical treatments. To fully heal myself and recover, I resorted to collaborating with other researchers and medical doctors to pioneer a novel treatment protocol using experimental nano-mineral treatments to facilitate antibiotic delivery across the blood-brain barrier, combat intracellular infection, and dissolve biofilms. It involves intravenous treatment with nano-silver, nano-gold, and trace minerals (oligotherapy), energetically treated by a plasma arc to increase resonance potential and efficacy. No doubt, my willingness to use my own body as a guinea pig was a risk—but a calculated risk that ultimately paid off by returning my health to 100% capacity. My decision to take such a personal risk was deeply rooted in basic science and empirical data, combined with my knowledge of the human body as its own ecosystem with resilience, hysteresis, and multi-system dynamics with synergistic properties. Hence, my training in complex, adaptive systems indirectly helped return me to life.

My experience with infectious disease science is distinct from my marine ecosystem expertise but both our human bodies and the oceans are complex, adaptive systems with non-linear dynamics and multiple stable states. For professional and personal reasons, I welcome this opportunity to study the underlying theory of complex systems. I welcome meeting all of you!

I'd say the common theme in my research projects is ""relativity""—the realization that something is actually much more observer-dependent that I had imagined. I find this idea enormously beautiful, and tend to look for it everywhere. Did you know that your red T-shirt will be blue to me if I run (very fast) into your arms?

A couple of random ideas:

- One interesting connection between physics and evolution I've come across is the ""fluctuation theorem"". This mathematical property of stochastic processes turns out to provide a common explanation to the second law of thermodynamics (increase of entropy) and Darwinian evolution (increase of fitness). I've blogged about this on John Baez's ""Azimuth"" [1]. I'd love to know how you react to this surprising connection, and what outlook you see.

- The result which really got me excited about complex systems is West's and Bettencourt's ""scaling law of cities"" [2]. As far as I can tell, it's really the first ""law of cities"".

In the literature, CIB has been described as analogous to multi-value Kauffman nets and cellular automata.

I am self-taught in the CIB technique and look forward to learning more about graph theory and other versions of network analysis. I am interested in applying tools from complexity science to problems of decision making under uncertainty and to planning for socio-ecological resilience. My ideas for some connections are that decision making under uncertainty might be better aided through nested, conditional scenarios (as opposed to the presentation of small sets of alternative horizontal scenarios, which is currently the dominant practice).

The signal is given to the network and a linear readout layer performs a linear combination of the states to produce the target output. The weights of the linear combination is calculated using linear regression which can be performed in closed form efficiently. My goal is to understand this paradigm better and study what kinds of problems they can and they cannot solve and how the paradigm can be applied to unconventional computing substrates such as nanoscale self-assembled electronics or DNA molecules.

My most recent work on reservoir computing is the direct estimation of error in task solving based on the structure of the dynamical system and statics of the input and output. The approach is currently limited to linear systems but I'm hoping to extend it to nonlinear systems and systems with finite dynamic range. I would be happy to talk about this more to other summer school students and even collaborate on taking it further.",,Male,PhD Student,University of New Mexico,United States,301-400,2014,Santa Fe,Kyle,

Currently working on the architecture-based algorithm decomposition approach, which uses patterns and certain characteristics of a computational kernel to map the kernel onto the most suitable processing device in a hybrid architecture. Also working on developing mathematical foundations for patterns in parallel programming.

Use cases are based on real-world problems in Computational Biology and Geophysics. These use cases have been acquired during collaborative simulation development projects with the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology and the GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences.

I'm currently also supervising a project on developing a GPU-accelerated Path Integral Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating Quantum Annealing in the Random Field Ising Model.

How Artificial Intelligence Can Inform Neuroscience: A Recipe for Conscious Machines?,,,"Life Sciences, Computing",5,Fahad Khalid,Computer Science,Computing,"I'm a PhD student with the HPI Research School on Service Oriented Systems Engineering, and member of the Operating Systems and Middleware Group.

Primary research theme is programming models for hybrid CPU-GPU parallel computing. Devising strategies to balance the productivity vs. performance trade-off inherent in programming massively parallel hybrid architectures. Currently working on the architecture-based algorithm decomposition approach, which uses patterns and certain characteristics of a computational kernel to map the kernel onto the most suitable processing device in a hybrid architecture. Also working on developing mathematical foundations for patterns in parallel programming.

Use cases are based on real-world problems in Computational Biology and Geophysics. These use cases have been acquired during collaborative simulation development projects with the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology and the GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences.

I'm currently also supervising a project on developing a GPU-accelerated Path Integral Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating Quantum Annealing in the Random Field Ising Model. The objective is to develop a high performance simulator for Adiabatic Quantum Computing (AQC) chips. Such a simulator will make it possible to design and evaluate programming models for AQC.

Align with my broad research area, I am interested in machine learning, data mining, dynamical system theory, artificial intelligence, computational learning theory, physics of disordered systems, complex networks and related fields.

Currently, my focus is on reservoir computing, which is a new paradigm in neural networks and has shown great performance in non-linear and chaotic signal processing. In contrast to traditional neural networks, in which the system is fine tuned using a learning algorithm to solve a particular task, in reservoir computing a recurrent neural network is initialized and fixed with no further fine tuning. The signal is given to the network and a linear readout layer performs a linear combination of the states to produce the target output. The weights of the linear combination is calculated using linear regression which can be performed in closed form efficiently. My goal is to understand this paradigm better and study what kinds of problems they can and they cannot solve and how the paradigm can be applied to unconventional computing substrates such as nanoscale self-assembled electronics or DNA molecules.

My most recent work on reservoir computing is the direct estimation of error in task solving based on the structure of the dynamical system and statics of the input and output. The approach is currently limited to linear systems but I'm hoping to extend it to nonlinear systems and systems with finite dynamic range. I would be happy to talk about this more to other summer school students and even collaborate on taking it further.",,Male,PhD Student,University of New Mexico,United States,301-400,2014,Santa Fe,Kyle,

Mapping Complexity/Human Knowledge as a Complex Adaptive System,,,Computing,2,Anna Zaytseva,Information Systems,Computing,"I am doing my PhD in Information Systems at the University of Oslo in Norway (3rd year), and soon I am going to get my degree. I apply the approach of Complex Adaptive Systems to generate a stepwise method to study mutual shaping between technologies and law, so the space in between those two – at the edge – is in focus. That space is a CAS with memory. I have two case studies of radically different e-health technologies of Norway, and each case has an own CAS. A CAS initially consists of about a hundred to almost a thousand smallest elements depending on the scale of a case. The elements are legal as norms & values, technologic as technical & conceptual, and social in situ & ex situ for the design work. Having appeared once, the elements of each CAS re-appear in time and increase in quantity to several thousand, what makes the memories be path-dependent and highly interconnected inside. Although the research is completely qualitative, manual and bottom-up, it provides a non-linear analysis of the phenomenon of mutual shaping between technologies and law with large visual representations at each subsequent step conducted in accordance with rules, which I have generated from one case study and replicated in another. In my method, I trace causalities in the CAS(s) and test a hypothesis whether attractors in the legal environment are shared among the design works on those technologies. Three attractors from four vs. six are shared, whereas the remaining ones invite a third case study. Unique technical implications in specific shapes and their information loops with the legal environment are indicated and the reasons explained. The research provides a transdisciplinary path for studying the complexity between law and technologies and calls specialists in the local fields – law, design studies and organization science – to examine the findings in detail by use of their own discipline methodologies.

My own initial background is in law, which I got at the National Research University – Higher School of Economics in Russia, and I wrote my Master’s thesis on policy analysis of standardization in six innovation markets of the European Union, what I did at Linköping University in Sweden. Besides, I have work experience both in public and private organizations. I am very interested in technologies and their architectures, as well as approaches to anticipate future. I have my own home library in Complexity Science that I consider to be advanced transdisciplinary methodology in harmony with nature. Therefore, at CSSS 2015 I am particularly interested to learn more about emerging transdisciplinary approaches for data analysis, where meanings behind words play crucial role. I am also concerned about visualization issues, co-evolution phenomena, bottom-up analytic strategies for complex systems research, information theory aspects, and simplicity behind the variety of self-organization forms. I vote for proper respect of sciences to each other, their synthesis and tight international collaboration, what I want to work for. So, I am also looking for colleagues and friends.",,Female,Student,University of Oslo,Norway,51-100,2015,Santa Fe,Jackie,Published: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cplx.21799
Complex Systems Techniques applied to Power Transmission Expansion Planning,"Choosing how new lines should be installed in a power grid, or Transmission Expansion Planning (TEP) is a problem of considerable complexity. Any power grid has a large number (hundreds to tens of thousands) of components, meaning that any upgrades must take into account the current infrastructure. Additionally, there are many possible additional lines that one could add to an existing power grid. Furthermore, any design must be weighted by investment and operation cost. This requires analyzing the optimal use of generation and transmission assets using optimal power flow models that simulate the physical laws governing power flows (Kirchhoff’s Laws) as well as infrastructure limits. Given the importance of this problem, many approaches have been tested. However, we found that there were still some tools, related to the Complex Systems environment, which have not yet been applied in this field. We therefore undertake the project of exploring the possibilities of some of these tools. The research we have completed while at CSSS has allowed us to write three working papers, each detailing a different application of Complex Systems tools to TEP:

An Individualist Theory of Collective Knowledge Creation,,,Social and behavioural science,3,Anna Zaytseva,Information Systems,Computing,"I am doing my PhD in Information Systems at the University of Oslo in Norway (3rd year), and soon I am going to get my degree. I apply the approach of Complex Adaptive Systems to generate a stepwise method to study mutual shaping between technologies and law, so the space in between those two – at the edge – is in focus. That space is a CAS with memory. I have two case studies of radically different e-health technologies of Norway, and each case has an own CAS. A CAS initially consists of about a hundred to almost a thousand smallest elements depending on the scale of a case. The elements are legal as norms & values, technologic as technical & conceptual, and social in situ & ex situ for the design work. Having appeared once, the elements of each CAS re-appear in time and increase in quantity to several thousand, what makes the memories be path-dependent and highly interconnected inside. Although the research is completely qualitative, manual and bottom-up, it provides a non-linear analysis of the phenomenon of mutual shaping between technologies and law with large visual representations at each subsequent step conducted in accordance with rules, which I have generated from one case study and replicated in another. In my method, I trace causalities in the CAS(s) and test a hypothesis whether attractors in the legal environment are shared among the design works on those technologies. Three attractors from four vs. six are shared, whereas the remaining ones invite a third case study. Unique technical implications in specific shapes and their information loops with the legal environment are indicated and the reasons explained. The research provides a transdisciplinary path for studying the complexity between law and technologies and calls specialists in the local fields – law, design studies and organization science – to examine the findings in detail by use of their own discipline methodologies.

My own initial background is in law, which I got at the National Research University – Higher School of Economics in Russia, and I wrote my Master’s thesis on policy analysis of standardization in six innovation markets of the European Union, what I did at Linköping University in Sweden. Besides, I have work experience both in public and private organizations. I am very interested in technologies and their architectures, as well as approaches to anticipate future.

By the use of dynamic topic modeling (DTM) and topological data analysis (TDA) we show that both members and parties feature specific roles within the system, consistent over time, and extract global patterns indicating levels of political cohesion.",,Social and behavioural science,8,Michael Smallegan,"Physics, Biology",Physical sciences;Life sciencess,"Michael Smallegan is a researcher at the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the Epigenetics Theme.

Simple Agent-Based Model of the Development of Trust in Hierarchical Organizations,"Hierarchical organizations typically rely on a chain of command in which supervisors instruct subordinates to perform certain actions in order to advance the interests and objectives of the organization. The trust between supervisors and subordinates is essential for the functioning of such hierarchical organizations, as it ensures the eventual execution of instructions. Despite this, blind trust and obedience may lead to the execution of instructions with negative consequences, which may have been avoided had a subordinate been more critical of a supervisor’s instructions. We thus aim to model the development of trust between subordinates, their supervisors and the structures of the organization itself, subject to the understanding of the consequences of instructions by subordinates and the eventual outcomes of executed instructions. This is achieved through the construction of an agent-based model that is capable of replicating a number of intuitive behaviors and the use of this model to provide an indication of how trust develops over time.",,Business and administration,7,Nai Seng Wong,Business,Business and administration,"Head of Policy, Risk and Surveillance Group in Singapore's central bank.

I have spoken publicly (radio and television, public gatherings and seminars) and have presented scientific communications on my research around the world (so far in France, Australia and Mexico).

Research interests
My research interests aim at integrating dynamical and complex systems’ views in psychology (epistemology-wise as well as in clinical practice). I particularly focus on fractals and their relation to psychoanalysis and psychic phenomena in clinical settings, but also taking into account neuroscience, sociology, linguistics and behavior. Outside of traditional human sciences, I have focused on fractals, attractors, self-similarity, nodes, dissipative systems, phase transitions and feedback loops. This multidisciplinary approach sheds light on clinical treatment, repetition, symptoms, projection, bodily manifestations and psychopathological structures such as autism, psychosis, neurosis and their relation to the culture they are engrained in.

Current Research
I am currently doing my PH.D. at the Center for Research in Psychoanalysis, Medicine and Society at the University of Paris 7, Sorbonne-Cité, Denis-Diderot. My focus is on Fractals and the Psyche; repetition, structure and self-similarity. This research contributes to clinical, as well as epistemological aspects in the field of psychology. Fractals seem to be a key to understanding repetitive symptoms and maladaptive response systems, crucial factors for the efficiency of therapy. On the other hand, I strive to integrate recent developments of complex systems, chaos theory, and specifically fractal geometry in my field. Some efforts to explore this multidisciplinary junction have already been explored around the world with promising results, but it seems we have just seen the tip of the iceberg in a field where there is still much to do.

Opportunistic attachment assembles plant–pollinator networks,"Species and interactions are being lost at alarming rates and it is imperative to understand how communities assemble if we have to prevent their collapse and restore lost interactions. Using an
8-year dataset comprising nearly 20 000 pollinator visitation records, we explore the assembly of plant–pollinator communities at native plant restoration sites in an agricultural landscape. We
find that species occupy highly dynamic network positions through time, causing the assembly process to be punctuated by major network reorganisations. The most persistent pollinator species
are also the most variable in their network positions, contrary to what preferential attachment – the most widely studied theory of ecological network assembly – predicts. Instead, we suggest
assembly occurs via an opportunistic attachment process. Our results contribute to our understanding of how communities assembly and how species interactions change through time while
helping to inform efforts to reassemble robust communities.",,Life sciences,3,Marilia P.

Human Path Finding in a Semantic Word Game,"Human decision-making processes are inevitably influenced by mental images, which are triggered by cues such as objects,
concepts, and words. The cognitive associations between words can be captured and represented as a semantic network,
in which words represent nodes and association between words are edges. How efficiently can humans traverse this word
association network to a given target word if, at each moment, they can only make choices about the next word they will visit?
Using participant traversal data from the appropriately designed semantic game MindPaths, we show that human players
do not rely on guessing, but navigate this association network quite efficiently, finding a specified target word often in the
minimal number of steps. We construct models to capture human paths within the MindPaths game. We find that similarity in
overall game length is easy to achieve with a trained random walker. We then consider a model of individual choices using
Bayesian estimation of transition probabilities conditional on local network connectivity. We find that it is difficult to capture the
individual decisions or the decision making process of human players. More complex models driven by semantic similarities

Human Path Finding in a Semantic Word Game,"Human decision-making processes are inevitably influenced by mental images, which are triggered by cues such as objects,
concepts, and words. The cognitive associations between words can be captured and represented as a semantic network,
in which words represent nodes and association between words are edges. How efficiently can humans traverse this word
association network to a given target word if, at each moment, they can only make choices about the next word they will visit?
Using participant traversal data from the appropriately designed semantic game MindPaths, we show that human players
do not rely on guessing, but navigate this association network quite efficiently, finding a specified target word often in the
minimal number of steps. We construct models to capture human paths within the MindPaths game. We find that similarity in
overall game length is easy to achieve with a trained random walker. We then consider a model of individual choices using
Bayesian estimation of transition probabilities conditional on local network connectivity. We find that it is difficult to capture the
individual decisions or the decision making process of human players. More complex models driven by semantic similarities
and other types of relations between words are necessary to fully understand how individuals choose a particular path within
this semantic word game.",,Social and behavioural science,3,Nicole Beckage,"Computer Science, Cognitive Science",Computing,Nicole Beckage is a PhD student in Computer Science and Cognitive Science at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Research interests
My research interests aim at integrating dynamical and complex systems’ views in psychology (epistemology-wise as well as in clinical practice).

Outside of traditional human sciences, I have focused on fractals, attractors, self-similarity, nodes, dissipative systems, phase transitions and feedback loops. This multidisciplinary approach sheds light on clinical treatment, repetition, symptoms, projection, bodily manifestations and psychopathological structures such as autism, psychosis, neurosis and their relation to the culture they are engrained in.

Human Group Dynamics; Coupling a Thematic and Acoustic Analysis on an Interdisciplinary Operative Group Model,,,Social and behavioural science;Physical sciences,9,Gaetano Dato,History,Humanities,"I am a research fellow at the University of Trieste, Italy. The quest for the “big picture” was what attracted me to the study of human history. My research track began with maritime and social history of the borderland area between Italy, Austria and Yugoslavia in 19th and 20th century. It continued, during my Ph.D., on memory studies and the analysis of the political exploitation of history.

In July 2015 I began a new research focused on the role of the British community and capital in the free port of Trieste, from 1810s to WW1. It regards the European convergence of the 19th c., while the great divergence between the West and the rest was in action.

Pretty much phenomena in historical human behavior have terrific analogies with many other phenomena with which CAS did very well. The engagement between CAS and historiography, begun in Big History, is making a great deal in enhancing the relationship between STEM and HSS. In my field, it can deliver an outstanding contribution to the knowledge of the history of globalization, leading to a fresh view on our times. There are plenty of historical data out there!",,Male,Researcher,University of Trieste,Italy,Unlisted,2016,Santa Fe,Jackie,
Organic urban boundaries and clusters - analyzing Singapore as an example,"Cities are dynamic complex systems evolving through their functions and human activities. While the regional boundaries are artificially created, dwellers move around them by walking, cycling or taking vehicles with various purposes and such movements in the cities generate “organic” boundaries. In this paper, we introduce how to extract such organic boundaries of cities based on the human mobility data and apply the method to analyze Singapore. We first create Voronoi cells, i.e. unit regions, of the city by using the public transportation and population datasets. Then we spatially interpolate the cells and create the mobility network of the interpolated cells by using the mobility dataset. Applying community detection unveils the organic regions in Singapore and we see that in those self-organizing regions the number of population and facilities have scaling relationships.

Classification of dragon-king phases in preferential attachment and failure models,"A new case of a preferential attachment model is considered. The probability that an already existing node in a network acquires a link to a new node is proportional to the product of its intrinsic fitness and its degree. We enrich this already known model by preferential deletion, which removes nodes at random with probability proportional to their fitness to some exponent ω. Under ‘normal’ conditions, the resulting node degree distribution is an asymptotic power-law (scale-free regime). We derive an exact condition for a phase transition after which one or a few nodes capture a finite fraction of all links in the infinite networks (dragonking regime).

"Quantifying and comparing “memory” in biological, ecological, physical, and socio-economic systems","Most real-world systems demonstrate in their behavior some degree of dependence on past behavior and conditions, or some capacity to store information about the past in their dynamics. This ”memory” of a system, be it cognitive or ecological, cultural or physical, has vital implications for those who wish to infer and predict the states and behavior of that system. Each discipline defines memory in its own way, as legacy effects, information transmitted from past to future, information stored in a process, cross-generational response to stimulus, etc. We use an information theoretic framework to unite these definitions and attempt to draw useful comparisons between systems spanning the biological, physical, and social spheres. To do this, we worked with epsilon machines (εM), a type of hidden Markov model in which the states represent causal pasts. We used a technique known as causal state splitting reconstruction (CSSR) to infer these machines from both synthetic data and real-world observations. To develop an inferential basis for statistical complexity using the εM approach, we performed benchmarking experiments, and showed that statistical complexity is positively correlated with memory strength and the pattern is consistent across most realistic perturbation levels and alphabet sizes.

Inferring Functional Taxonomy from Network Structure,"The projection of bipartite graphs has proven to be a useful tool to infer similarity measures between nodes of either one of the node types, based on how many links they share with nodes of another type. In economics this has lead to the concept of the product space (Hidalgo et al. 2007), which is a network that connects products based on their co-locations in different countries. The relatedness between products in this networks is thought to be representative of the ’capabilities’ that are required to produce such products. Here we apply similar concepts to plant-pollinator networks and evaluate the results in light of natural history. By projecting plant-pollinator networks onto plant-plant and pollinator-pollinator networks, we aim to derive a measure of relatedness between plants based on the ecological traits that a pollinator must have to feed on it, and likewise a measure of relatedness between pollinators in terms of the traits they share, that allow them to feed on the same plants. By running community detection algorithms on the projected networks we create a functional taxonomy based on these (unobserved) ecological traits, and compare this taxonomy to taxonomies based on observable traits. As opposed to evolutionary taxonomies, our inferred taxonomies can represent a ’partner space,’ describing how plants see their pollinator community in terms of their capabilities and vice versa. Trait-based community detection formalizes the concept of ’pollination syndromes,’ the idea that pollinators in a pollination network with similar traits prefer similar plants with similar traits (e.g. flies pollinators prefer white-flowered plants) (Willmer 2011). We find that detected communities (Figure 1) are well-aligned with pollination guilds formed from field observations of flower visitors but that most basic (empirically-recorded) plant traits are not predictive of the communities observed from the projected plant-pollinator networks, suggesting that other traits play a significant role in plant choice for pollinators.

This indicates the non-trivial nature of the communities identified by looking at plant-pollinator networks, reinforces criticisms of pollination syndromes, and may inspire future ecological research such as the identification of characteristic ecological traits that form these communities.",,Life sciences;Computing,4,Alje van Dam,"Mathematics, Innovation Science",Mathematics and statistics;Business and administration,"I am a 25 year old Dutch first-year PhD student. I did my BSc and MSc in mathematics and just started my PhD in innovation science. I study the origins of innovation and invention and the conditions that give rise to new knowledge. To do this, I try to quantify how knowledge recombines, the distance between knowledge and the complexity of knowledge using network and information theory. In practice, knowledge is measured through e.g. products, services, patents or occupations. Relatedness can then be measured through co-location or co-classifications, and complexity can be measured by for example the ease of recombination. I am also interested in explaining why complex knowledge scales with city size (in other words, is concentrated in space). I do this by measuring interdependencies between occupations and trying to quantify synergies and redundancies between occupations. In a broader sense I'm interested in cultural evolution, economic development, dynamical systems, percolation and autocatalytic networks.

Topological analysis of idealized and empirical fitness landscapes,"In this work, we provide such summary statistics using the tools of topological data analysis, in particular based on the technique of persistent homology. We adapt the methods of persistent homology to the lattice structure of fitness landscapes and define two cubical complex filtrations reflecting two different notions of landscape complexity, one capturing local optima and trap-like “bumpy” landscape geometry, and the other capturing epistasis and dependencies between different mutations. We demonstrate that the topological invariants we compute resolve the full range of landscape complexity produced by the mathematical NK and Rough Mount Fuji models of “tunably rugged” landscapes. We then apply the same methods to a large dataset of empirical transcription factor binding affinity landscapes, extending the results of a recent work on simpler summary statistics of these landscapes. We argue that the barcode and Betti number plots of persistence diagrams popular in the persistent homology literature give a finergrained description of landscape complexity than numerical summary statistics. To further demonstrate the usefulness of these descriptions, we use the notions of bottleneck and Wasserstein distance between persistence diagrams to define a metric structure on fitness landscapes, and describe how clustering in this metric space relates to conventional categorizations of transcription factors.",,Life sciences;Mathematics and statistics,2,Ximo Pechuan,Biology,Life sciences,"Research in theoretical evolutionary biology with the ultimate aim of generating a precise language to understand the deterministic component of the evolutionary process, regardless of the particularities of the biosphere that implements it.

Agent-Based Prediction Competition,"We independently propose an Agent-Based Prediction Competition. We generate synthetic data from a financial market ABM.

Our goal is to check whether prediction is at all possible, and whether more complex models (such as the other ABMs) outperform simpler or statistical models. We show that in this case, a single realization of the ABM cannot be reliably predicted at all with any of the tested methods. A substantial level of noise casts a strong limit on the predictive power of the models. Considering the average realization of the out-of-sample stock prices, complex ABMs outperform simpler ABMs, dynamical systems and statistical methods.

unique to the pair. These definitions have not been stringently applied to improvisational dance,

3 videos of improvisation pairs. We record the point of contact for each partner, and then use this
information to compute measures of mutual information and entropy rate. We find that mutual
information between partners is higher as the level of the improvisation grows, which is consistent

Characterizing Atrial Fibrillation Dynamics using Multiplex Visibility Graphs,"We performed simulations of normal rhythm and fibrillatory dynamics using the mono-domain formulation of the Rogers and McCulloch model. Clinical data were recorded from 4 patients with atrial fibrillation before and after successful catheter ablation procedure using a multi-electrode basket catheter. From multivariate times series of simulated and clinical data, we constructed multiplex visibility graphs. We then compared the structural properties of multiplex visibility graphs between time series from healthy and fibrillatory rhythms. For both simulations and clinical data, the giant component of the multiplex visibility graph was higher in time series of normal rhythm compared to time series of fibrillatory rhythms. The structural efficiency of the multiplex graphs was higher in normal rhythm compared to fibrillatory rhythms. Multiplex visibility graphs provide novel insights in cardiac dynamics, paving the way for a more in-depth characterization of fibrillatory rhythms. In particular, normal sinus rhythm is associated with multiplex visibility graphs that have greater connectivity and structural efficiency compared to fibrillatory dynamics.

Scaling of Sensory Information Intake in Organisms,"The metabolic resources required by organisms are known to scale with their mass raised to the 3/4 power. Like energy and nutrients, information about the environment is also a necessary resource for life. However, little attention has been placed on how the capacity to absorb information scales with size. We have taken steps toward answering this question by a) synthesizing data on sensory capacity from multiple organisms to try and answer the question empirically and b) exploring theoretical considerations that might allow us to deduce the scaling laws from first principles. We hypothesize that as organisms increase in size and complexity, their sensory capacity per unit mass decreases, owing to the fact that less total information is needed if it can be processed in a more sophisticated manner. Preliminary results, both theoretical and empirical, are supportive of this claim. In particular, we derive a fundamental bound on the sensory capacity of a spherical cell arising from the heat it dissipates, which turns out to be a linear function of the cell radius r. As the mass of a cell scales as r3, our bound implies that the maximum achievable channel capacity per unit mass decreases with the size of the organism.

Translating from Nature to Technology: Framework to Compare Innovation Pathways in Biomimicry,"Biomimicry is a growing area of research that seeks to abstract functions and architectures observed in nature to solve problems in science and engineering. Previous studies have documented biomimicry efforts in individual subfields, and discussed the philosophical foundations of biomimicry as a sustainability-oriented innovation strategy. Less work has been done, however, on describing the individual steps of abstraction taken in the course of biomimicry innovation efforts. Studying this question can add to an understanding of how the process of replicating or mimicking nature works in practice, and whether successful outcomes result from similar inputs. Here we begin to address this gap by compiling a database of the most widely discussed biomimicry applications.

Fluctuations in 1D Point Patterns,"Random point patterns with similar apparent characteristics (such as density of points) may display very different behaviours when it comes to the way these points are distributed in space. Strongly negatively correlated points (e.g. due to repulsive forces) show a high degree of order, whereas strongly positively correlated points (e.g. due to attractive forces) show clustering and hence, a high degree of disorder. These two extreme cases define a spectrum where point patterns are classified according to their fluctuations from small fluctuations (order, hyperuniformity) to large fluctuations (disorder, clustering). Point patterns with weak correlations show the same trend in their fluctuations as the typical uncorrelated case and are said to display Poisson-like behaviour. In this report, we show numerical results on different one-dimensional point patterns both computer generated and experimentally obtained (heartbeat recordings).

Talking Loud Or Talking Often: How the Interplay Between Network Structure and Agent Influence Affects the Time to Reach Consensus in Collective Decision-Making,"Consensus-seeking processes are core mechanisms for social organization in non-human animal groups, human societies, artificial and multi-agent systems. Such processes consist of a series of negotiations between individuals, which ultimately aggregate different individual opinions into one common agreed decision. Related works have shown that a small number of influential and highly centralized agents i.e. leaders, considerably speed up the consensus-seeking process. Yet the important features of hierarchy and leaders have not been clearly identified and their investigation in experiments provide contradictory evidence. To disentangle these effects, we separate two features of hierarchy (i) the level of centralization ν and (ii) the number of leaders NL, i.e. influential individuals. We therefore developed a continuous opinion formation model to explore the effect of each feature and their interplay on the time to reach a global consensus. The results show that the most important feature is the topology of the network structure, with higher centralization always decreasing the time to reach consensus. In addition, it also demonstrates that the effect of influential individuals are deeply entangled with the underlying network structure. Indeed, it can be beneficial to have a few leaders if the structure is centralized, but surprisingly it can also be detrimental if the population is homogeneous.

Talking Loud Or Talking Often: How the Interplay Between Network Structure and Agent Influence Affects the Time to Reach Consensus in Collective Decision-Making,"Consensus-seeking processes are core mechanisms for social organization in non-human animal groups, human societies, artificial and multi-agent systems. Such processes consist of a series of negotiations between individuals, which ultimately aggregate different individual opinions into one common agreed decision. Related works have shown that a small number of influential and highly centralized agents i.e. leaders, considerably speed up the consensus-seeking process. Yet the important features of hierarchy and leaders have not been clearly identified and their investigation in experiments provide contradictory evidence. To disentangle these effects, we separate two features of hierarchy (i) the level of centralization ν and (ii) the number of leaders NL, i.e. influential individuals. We therefore developed a continuous opinion formation model to explore the effect of each feature and their interplay on the time to reach a global consensus. The results show that the most important feature is the topology of the network structure, with higher centralization always decreasing the time to reach consensus. In addition, it also demonstrates that the effect of influential individuals are deeply entangled with the underlying network structure. Indeed, it can be beneficial to have a few leaders if the structure is centralized, but surprisingly it can also be detrimental if the population is homogeneous. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation of the “babble” hypothesis which stresses the importance of talkativeness and extraversion of leaders. Further directions involve a full characterization of the main mechanisms leading to polarization or fragmentation as final states in more complex network structures, such as modular structures with nested hierarchies.",,Social and behavioural science,4,Zohar Neu,Mathematics,Mathematics and statistics,Zohar is a PhD student at the University of Bristol.

Weighted Expectations,"Applying Valence-Weighted Distance (VWD), a novel probability weighting function developed by Mikaela, to a dynamic asset pricing model to explain emergent aggregate behavior.

Probability functions are applied in the context of non-expected utility theories to explain deviations of individual decision makers from the predictions of expected utility theory. A plethora of research has found that people tend to overweight small probabilities and underweight larger probabilities -- however, the psychological bases of this tendency remain unclear.

Grounded in psychophysics, VWD builds on information theoretic principles and aims to provide a psychological explanation for the shape and parameter fits of existing probability weighting functions (Tversky & Kahneman, Prelec, LinLog).

Concave Utility as Efficient Encoding,"Analogously, it is well established within economics and psychology that the utility of money (or any other commodity) is concave -- i.e. that decision makers perceive the difference between e.g. $1 and $2 as greater than the difference between $101 and $102. The concavity of utility has been previously explained e.g. with outcome sampling and comparison in the choice environment (Stewart, 2009), the dissociation between large monetary outcomes and outcomes experienced in everyday life, and the notion of the human mind/brain as an efficient transduction system (e.g. Arkes, 1991; Summerfield & Tsetsos, 2015). As far as Mikaela knows, the latter notion has not yet been formally explored outside an experimental context, i.e. through simulating distributions of economic transactions in the actual environment in which decision makers tested in psychological or economic studies make their purchases.

Provisional idea:
Get distributions of economic transactions in different societies
Simulate a decision maker that encodes monetary value optimally given the prevalence of transactions in that society

The individual lives of microbial cells: evolution of phenotypic diversity in a bacterial population,"Scientists tend to appreciate microbes for their simplicity and predictability: if you put a population of genetically identical cells in a uniform environment, we assume they will all behave in the same way.

In others, it seems to be an evolved trait, often in response to environmental stress, that confers increased fitness on the population as a whole even if some individuals are not behaving in an optimal way. How does phenotypic heterogeneity evolve? In what environments is it advantageous for all cells to behave the same way, and in what environments is diversity beneficial?

Game Warping,"What if players can transform a noncooperative game to a cooperative positive-sum game? This is possible in certain digital economic systems (such as those on a blockchain) because all contracts are strictly enforceable. These type of ""game-warping"" transformations are interesting because given any economic model with pre-defined rules, the agents are able to develop unforeseeable cooperation strategies, form coalitions, and expand the scope of potential actions over time. Effectively, players are collectively able to overturn the system dynamics. The economy evolves because the economic rules effectively change w/ time (anyone play Baba Is You?). ""Game warping"" is defined as using transparent, triggerable, unstoppable punishments to move game-theoretic equilibria. We can extend this to multiple players and model the system using a graph/network, to explore what different cooperation strategies emerge.

Probability functions are applied in the context of non-expected utility theories to explain deviations of individual decision makers from the predictions of expected utility theory. A plethora of research has found that people tend to overweight small probabilities and underweight larger probabilities -- however, the psychological bases of this tendency remain unclear.

Grounded in psychophysics, VWD builds on information theoretic principles and aims to provide a psychological explanation for the shape and parameter fits of existing probability weighting functions (Tversky & Kahneman, Prelec, LinLog).

Is entropy sexy?,"We are interested in studying bird species with complex courtship displays to understand how the predictability of a display is correlated with mating success. Individual birds may vary the sequence or types of moves in a display to attract a mate. However, it is not known whether males with more or less predictable dances fare better. A given performance may be unpredictable with respect to the preceeding steps in the sequence or to a canonical performance that forms the basis for most displays in that species. Using Shannon entropy, we will develop a measure of surprise (within a sequence) and novelty (relative to canonical sequence) in courtship displays and apply it to a dataset of annotated performances where the subsequent mating success of performers is known.

Concave Utility as Efficient Encoding,"Analogously, it is well established within economics and psychology that the utility of money (or any other commodity) is concave -- i.e. that decision makers perceive the difference between e.g. $1 and $2 as greater than the difference between $101 and $102. The concavity of utility has been previously explained e.g. with outcome sampling and comparison in the choice environment (Stewart, 2009), the dissociation between large monetary outcomes and outcomes experienced in everyday life, and the notion of the human mind/brain as an efficient transduction system (e.g. Arkes, 1991; Summerfield & Tsetsos, 2015). As far as Mikaela knows, the latter notion has not yet been formally explored outside an experimental context, i.e. through simulating distributions of economic transactions in the actual environment in which decision makers tested in psychological or economic studies make their purchases.

Get distributions of economic transactions in different societies
Simulate a decision maker that encodes monetary value optimally given the prevalence of transactions in that society

Chaotic Brain,"Some of us are looking at chaos in the brain and how state-transitions in EEG waves may relate to learning/uncertainty-reduction/entropy. This refers to what Liz mentioned on day 1, where EEG waves of a healthy brain displayed a qualitative change in dynamics (bifurcation) when a parameter was changed, i.e., from *chaotic to more periodic*, under the influence of specific drugs. We also learned that the rabbit brain, when remembering a familiar smell as opposed to an unfamiliar smell, displayed a switch from chaotic to periodic attractor. We are asking the question of what other events may trigger a qualitative change in dynamics from chaotic to periodic, e.g., meditation, sleep or flow experiences, and what they have in common? The first step is to scan the literature.

Secondly, could it be that the above bifurcations in the brain correspond to human learning and reducing uncertainty in the sense of information theory, i.e., where a state of higher unfamiliarity and novelty corresponds to more chaotic states and familiarity to more periodic states?",,Social and behavioural science; Physical science,7,Mikaela Akrenius,Cognitive science,Social and behavioural science; Mathematics and statistics,"I am a fourth year PhD student in Cognitive Science at Indiana University Bloomington.

At the same time, we know where these languages are spoken today. The question, then: putting these two sources of data together, can we model the diffusion of languages over physical space and work backwards from the present day to infer the most likely homelands of the corresponding protolanguages? Can the predictions of such a model be made to align what we otherwise know about human migrations in the past?

Game Warping,"What if players can transform a noncooperative game to a cooperative positive-sum game? This is possible in certain digital economic systems (such as those on a blockchain) because all contracts are strictly enforceable. These type of ""game-warping"" transformations are interesting because given any economic model with pre-defined rules, the agents are able to develop unforeseeable cooperation strategies, form coalitions, and expand the scope of potential actions over time. Effectively, players are collectively able to overturn the system dynamics. The economy evolves because the economic rules effectively change w/ time (anyone play Baba Is You?). ""Game warping"" is defined as using transparent, triggerable, unstoppable punishments to move game-theoretic equilibria. We can extend this to multiple players and model the system using a graph/network, to explore what different cooperation strategies emerge.

When are people susceptible to adopting new ideas based upon their existing belief system?
How much easier is it for central nodes to spread ideas than nodes that are not connected to many others?

Resilence and presilience in protein network structure,"What happens when one introduces a novel piece of information to a semi structured system? Is the information purged, incorporated, or persist neutrally. There is a neat study of how networks seemingly become more redundant over time, specifically, the data describes protein interaction network across ~1800 species. Idea is to re-create this data and play around with it, ideally to check how the structure of the network may influence whether or not a new protein can be incorporated.

Why proteins? Mutations are the source of evolutionary novelty. Without evolutionary novelty, an organism will struggle to adapt to an alternating environment. Simultaneously, mutations are perceived to mostly be deleterious, causing negative fitness effects. Effectively, we are facing an evolutionary balance act between maintaining current functionality (selection against deleterious mutations), but also incorporating novelty (mutations, diversity) in order to stay opt in a constantly alternating environment. So, how can a systems incorporate novel information, without breaking the current functionality? You can think of proteins as a network of friends, and friends who introduce you to new friends. The practical nature of proteins, is that they have limited personality, thus they are easier to model.

Computational Synesthesia,"What data comprises the meaning of a word? Extant approaches to automated text analysis assume that the meaning of words can be inferred by examining co-occurrence relations (the bag-of-words approach) and formal semantic relationships among words (the linguistics approach). However, a large body of work illustrates that meaning is multimodal; i.e. words gain their meaning through their use in embodied multimodal contexts as labels that refer to “sensory images” – a property of meaning long known to artists, as in the use of visual imagery to inspire linguistically-mediated interpretations in the domain of painting, or in the use of words to evoke mental representations of sensory images in the domain of poetry. Here we propose a method for automated textual analysis that clusters words not based on text-to-text relations, but rather, in text-to-image relations, based on the structure of the sensory images associated with words. Specifically, we develop an automated approach for using large-scale search data from Google to retrieve a continuous set of images associated with search terms, and we provide information-theoretic measures for clustering search terms based on similarities in the color profile (such as ‘palette’) of . We explore how this clustering method can reveal novel dimensions of meaning previously unavailable through purely text-based methods of automated text analysis, for example, by finding unexpected similarities among search terms based on their color profile, or by providing novel measures for how abstract a word is based on the diversity of images associated with its use as a search term.",,Computing; Social and behavioural science,6,Ethan Nadler,,Physical sciences,"I'm a fourth-year Physics Ph.D. student at Stanford University.

Scrutinizing Early Warning Signals of Depression,"Historically, depression has been understood within a 'common cause' framework in which the associations between symptoms such as worry, sadness, and lack of sleep is due to an underlying latent variable. This is an extremely successful approach in medicine, where symptoms usually are due to some underlying biological disease. In psychology, this has been less successful.

Resilence and presilience in protein network structure,"What happens when one introduces a novel piece of information to a semi structured system?

Why proteins? Mutations are the source of evolutionary novelty. Without evolutionary novelty, an organism will struggle to adapt to an alternating environment. Simultaneously, mutations are perceived to mostly be deleterious, causing negative fitness effects.

The individual lives of microbial cells: evolution of phenotypic diversity in a bacterial population,"Scientists tend to appreciate microbes for their simplicity and predictability: if you put a population of genetically identical cells in a uniform environment, we assume they will all behave in the same way. However, in many cases this assumption is catastrophically wrong. We're frequently discovering new examples of clonal microbial populations that show diversity in a particular phenotype-- say, growth rate, substrate preference, or antibiotic tolerance-- in a way that is seemingly stochastic (not a case of plasticity in response to the environment). In some cases, this diversity may simply be noise with little consequence for the ecology of the population. In others, it seems to be an evolved trait, often in response to environmental stress, that confers increased fitness on the population as a whole even if some individuals are not behaving in an optimal way. How does phenotypic heterogeneity evolve? In what environments is it advantageous for all cells to behave the same way, and in what environments is diversity beneficial? How does the nature of the environmental stress influence the shape of the phenotypic distribution that will evolve? Can we call it ""bet-hedging"" or ""division of labor""? We are using agent-based modeling to explore these questions-- focusing first on the example of bacterial colonies growing in the face of antibiotic stress, but with the aim of building a generalizable model that can draw connections among different types of organisms and environments.",,Life sciences,6,Ritwika Vallomparambath PanikkasserySugasree,,Physical sciences,"I am a 4th year graduate student in Physics at the University of California, Merced.

Computational Synesthesia,"What data comprises the meaning of a word? Extant approaches to automated text analysis assume that the meaning of words can be inferred by examining co-occurrence relations (the bag-of-words approach) and formal semantic relationships among words (the linguistics approach). However, a large body of work illustrates that meaning is multimodal; i.e. words gain their meaning through their use in embodied multimodal contexts as labels that refer to “sensory images” – a property of meaning long known to artists, as in the use of visual imagery to inspire linguistically-mediated interpretations in the domain of painting, or in the use of words to evoke mental representations of sensory images in the domain of poetry. Here we propose a method for automated textual analysis that clusters words not based on text-to-text relations, but rather, in text-to-image relations, based on the structure of the sensory images associated with words. Specifically, we develop an automated approach for using large-scale search data from Google to retrieve a continuous set of images associated with search terms, and we provide information-theoretic measures for clustering search terms based on similarities in the color profile (such as ‘palette’) of . We explore how this clustering method can reveal novel dimensions of meaning previously unavailable through purely text-based methods of automated text analysis, for example, by finding unexpected similarities among search terms based on their color profile, or by providing novel measures for how abstract a word is based on the diversity of images associated with its use as a search term.",,Computing; Social and behavioural science,6,Bhargav Srinivasa Desikan,,Computing; Social and behavioural science,"Currently a graduate student at the University of Chicago, finishing an MA in Computational Social Science, and doing my research at the Knowledge Lab.

Resilience in Conway's Game of Life,"Resilience to environmental challenges is one of the hallmarks of life. The goal of this project would be to search for patterns in Conway's Game of Life that can cope with external perturbations and self-organize back into their original forms. Conway's Game of Life[1] is a cellular automaton that has raised a lot of attention due to the life-like forms that it generates. Cellular automata are computational models composed of a grid of cells that can be on either of two (or more) states. At every generation, each of these cells can change according to the state of their neighbours. Interestingly, Conway's Game of Life is Turing-complete, meaning that it can compute any computable function, including the Game of Life itself [2]. For this reason, one should expect to find a wide range of interesting patterns, including those that can detect external perturbations and repair themselves. By finding them, we would be providing a compelling example of one of life's key traits as an emergent behaviour in a simple computational environment.",,Computing; Mathematics and statistics,8,Wenqian Yin,,Engineering and engineering trades,"Wenqian Yin received the B.S. degree from Jiangsu University, Zhenjing, China in 2011 and the M.S. degree from Hohai University, Nanjing, China in 2015.

Evaluating Two Mechanisms for the Evolution of Social Complexity,"Theorists from Herbert Spencer to Brian Arthur assert that evolution drives an upward spiral of complexity, but the devil's in the details. How, exactly, does this process work? Presumably, multiple mechanisms operate and their relative importance varies from system to system. Focusing on a single type of systems, viz. social systems, this project aims to assess two competing accounts of the social evolution of complexity. Both hypotheses posit a feedback process by which group selection determines basic cultural/social features (see diagram). One camp, call them `pure cultural evolutionists', identifies the primary link as that between group functionality and social-moral rules. By contrast, a second group, `gene-culture evolutionists', asserts that the most important feedback links group functionality with the human genome. These theories are compatible, even complementary, but a question remains as to which provides a better explanation of the recent, massive increase in social complexity. To compare these two processes, we draw on a recently compiled composite measure of social complexity (whitehouse et. al.) as well as data on the evolution of the human genome and the evolution of social norms. We hypothesize that gene-culture evolution is far too slow to adequately explain the rapid and massive increase in social complexity, while pure cultural evolution provides a more satisfying account.",,Social and behavioural science,5,Dries Daems,Archaeology,Humanities,"I have a Ph.D. in Archaeology and am generally interested in studying long-term trajectories of social complexity, socio-ecological resilience, urbanization, and agent-based modeling.

Is entropy sexy?,"We are interested in studying bird species with complex courtship displays to understand how the predictability of a display is correlated with mating success. Individual birds may vary the sequence or types of moves in a display to attract a mate. However, it is not known whether males with more or less predictable dances fare better. A given performance may be unpredictable with respect to the preceeding steps in the sequence or to a canonical performance that forms the basis for most displays in that species. Using Shannon entropy, we will develop a measure of surprise (within a sequence) and novelty (relative to canonical sequence) in courtship displays and apply it to a dataset of annotated performances where the subsequent mating success of performers is known.

The question, then: putting these two sources of data together, can we model the diffusion of languages over physical space and work backwards from the present day to infer the most likely homelands of the corresponding protolanguages? Can the predictions of such a model be made to align what we otherwise know about human migrations in the past?

Why proteins? Mutations are the source of evolutionary novelty. Without evolutionary novelty, an organism will struggle to adapt to an alternating environment. Simultaneously, mutations are perceived to mostly be deleterious, causing negative fitness effects.

So, how can a systems incorporate novel information, without breaking the current functionality? You can think of proteins as a network of friends, and friends who introduce you to new friends.

We are asking the question of what other events may trigger a qualitative change in dynamics from chaotic to periodic, e.g., meditation, sleep or flow experiences, and what they have in common?

The individual lives of microbial cells: evolution of phenotypic diversity in a bacterial population,"Scientists tend to appreciate microbes for their simplicity and predictability: if you put a population of genetically identical cells in a uniform environment, we assume they will all behave in the same way. However, in many cases this assumption is catastrophically wrong. We're frequently discovering new examples of clonal microbial populations that show diversity in a particular phenotype-- say, growth rate, substrate preference, or antibiotic tolerance-- in a way that is seemingly stochastic (not a case of plasticity in response to the environment). In some cases, this diversity may simply be noise with little consequence for the ecology of the population. In others, it seems to be an evolved trait, often in response to environmental stress, that confers increased fitness on the population as a whole even if some individuals are not behaving in an optimal way.

Computational Synesthesia,"What data comprises the meaning of a word? Extant approaches to automated text analysis assume that the meaning of words can be inferred by examining co-occurrence relations (the bag-of-words approach) and formal semantic relationships among words (the linguistics approach). However, a large body of work illustrates that meaning is multimodal; i.e. words gain their meaning through their use in embodied multimodal contexts as labels that refer to “sensory images” – a property of meaning long known to artists, as in the use of visual imagery to inspire linguistically-mediated interpretations in the domain of painting, or in the use of words to evoke mental representations of sensory images in the domain of poetry. Here we propose a method for automated textual analysis that clusters words not based on text-to-text relations, but rather, in text-to-image relations, based on the structure of the sensory images associated with words. Specifically, we develop an automated approach for using large-scale search data from Google to retrieve a continuous set of images associated with search terms, and we provide information-theoretic measures for clustering search terms based on similarities in the color profile (such as ‘palette’) of . We explore how this clustering method can reveal novel dimensions of meaning previously unavailable through purely text-based methods of automated text analysis, for example, by finding unexpected similarities among search terms based on their color profile, or by providing novel measures for how abstract a word is based on the diversity of images associated with its use as a search term.",,Computing; Social and behavioural science,6,Douglas Guilbeault,,Social and behavioural science,"Doug is a graduate student in the Network Dynamics Group at the Annenberg School for Communication, Upenn, working with Damon Centola.

Resilence and presilience in protein network structure,"What happens when one introduces a novel piece of information to a semi structured system? Is the information purged, incorporated, or persist neutrally. There is a neat study of how networks seemingly become more redundant over time, specifically, the data describes protein interaction network across ~1800 species. Idea is to re-create this data and play around with it, ideally to check how the structure of the network may influence whether or not a new protein can be incorporated.

Why proteins? Mutations are the source of evolutionary novelty. Without evolutionary novelty, an organism will struggle to adapt to an alternating environment. Simultaneously, mutations are perceived to mostly be deleterious, causing negative fitness effects. Effectively, we are facing an evolutionary balance act between maintaining current functionality (selection against deleterious mutations), but also incorporating novelty (mutations, diversity) in order to stay opt in a constantly alternating environment. So, how can a systems incorporate novel information, without breaking the current functionality? You can think of proteins as a network of friends, and friends who introduce you to new friends. The practical nature of proteins, is that they have limited personality, thus they are easier to model.

Concave Utility as Efficient Encoding,"Analogously, it is well established within economics and psychology that the utility of money (or any other commodity) is concave -- i.e. that decision makers perceive the difference between e.g. $1 and $2 as greater than the difference between $101 and $102. The concavity of utility has been previously explained e.g. with outcome sampling and comparison in the choice environment (Stewart, 2009), the dissociation between large monetary outcomes and outcomes experienced in everyday life, and the notion of the human mind/brain as an efficient transduction system (e.g. Arkes, 1991; Summerfield & Tsetsos, 2015). As far as Mikaela knows, the latter notion has not yet been formally explored outside an experimental context, i.e. through simulating distributions of economic transactions in the actual environment in which decision makers tested in psychological or economic studies make their purchases.

Provisional idea:
Get distributions of economic transactions in different societies
Simulate a decision maker that encodes monetary value optimally given the prevalence of transactions in that society

We also learned that the rabbit brain, when remembering a familiar smell as opposed to an unfamiliar smell, displayed a switch from chaotic to periodic attractor. We are asking the question of what other events may trigger a qualitative change in dynamics from chaotic to periodic, e.g., meditation, sleep or flow experiences, and what they have in common? The first step is to scan the literature.

Secondly, could it be that the above bifurcations in the brain correspond to human learning and reducing uncertainty in the sense of information theory, i.e., where a state of higher unfamiliarity and novelty corresponds to more chaotic states and familiarity to more periodic states?",,Social and behavioural science; Physical science,7,Paula Parpart,Cognitive science,Social and behavioural science; Mathematics and statistics,"I am a computational cognitive scientist working on the intersection of machine learning and psychology.

The individual lives of microbial cells: evolution of phenotypic diversity in a bacterial population,"Scientists tend to appreciate microbes for their simplicity and predictability: if you put a population of genetically identical cells in a uniform environment, we assume they will all behave in the same way. However, in many cases this assumption is catastrophically wrong. We're frequently discovering new examples of clonal microbial populations that show diversity in a particular phenotype-- say, growth rate, substrate preference, or antibiotic tolerance-- in a way that is seemingly stochastic (not a case of plasticity in response to the environment). In some cases, this diversity may simply be noise with little consequence for the ecology of the population. In others, it seems to be an evolved trait, often in response to environmental stress, that confers increased fitness on the population as a whole even if some individuals are not behaving in an optimal way. How does phenotypic heterogeneity evolve? In what environments is it advantageous for all cells to behave the same way, and in what environments is diversity beneficial? How does the nature of the environmental stress influence the shape of the phenotypic distribution that will evolve? Can we call it ""bet-hedging"" or ""division of labor""?

A plethora of research has found that people tend to overweight small probabilities and underweight larger probabilities -- however, the psychological bases of this tendency remain unclear.

Grounded in psychophysics, VWD builds on information theoretic principles and aims to provide a psychological explanation for the shape and parameter fits of existing probability weighting functions (Tversky & Kahneman, Prelec, LinLog). In addition, VWD introduces novel (empirically testable) predictions, is sensitive to choice context, and has less free parameters than existing probability weighting functions.",,Social and behavioural science; Mathematics and statistics,5,Ahyan Panjwani,Economics,Social and behavioural science,"My areas of academic interest are financial markets and complexity as it pertains to them.

Artificial fossilization of animal interaction networks,"There has been a rapid increase in the number of papers applying network analysis to ancient communities, inferred from the fossil record. However, many of these studies don't account for the fact that the fossil record is incomplete. For example, most soft-bodied organisms don't preserve well. We hope to ground-truth investigations of past processes by analyzing how information loss affects the structure of modern interaction networks (co-occurrence, food webs, etc) and the inferences we make from them.",,Physical sciences,6,Jack Shaw,,Physical sciences,Graduate student in the Geology and Geophysics department at Yale University.

Toward an effective control of malaria in Ghana,"Malaria is a vector-borne disease endemic to many countries in Africa as well as in Asia. This disease results from an interaction between Anopheles gambiae (mosquito), Plasmodium falciparum (parasite) and the human (host). Since Ross division of the host population in purely homogenous compartments, many variants of the model were used to get insights into the transmission and some strategy to control the disease. Thanks to such a simplistic representation of the epidemic, malaria control is remaining since 1950 a nightmare for policymakers since the disease is still persisting though numerous control measures were applied. This study aims at testing the dilution theory while accounting for the spatial repartition of the disease incidence using an adaptive ABM.",,Health,4,Bhartendu Pandey,,Environmental protection; Architecture and building,Doctoral Candidate at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies.

Exploring climate belief dynamics in social networks,"The landscape of political thought is constantly changing, and whenever a new idea or policy enters the public discourse people must form an opinion about it based upon their existing belief system and the opinions of others in their social network. Sometimes the public reaches a majority consensus about a given issue. Other times no consensus is formed, and the population is split into relatively stable ideological factions instead.

Our goal is to answer some/all of these questions:

When are people susceptible to adopting new ideas based upon their existing belief system?
How much easier is it for central nodes to spread ideas than nodes that are not connected to many others?
When does a minority belief become a majority consensus opinion, and when does a population split into opposing factions?
How does this model apply to real-world political opinion dynamics, possibly including polling data on same-sex marriage and climate change?",,Social and behavioural science; Environmental protection,6,Jackie Brown,,Social and behavioural science; Architecture and building,I am an MES candidate studying urban planning at York University.

Computational Synesthesia,"What data comprises the meaning of a word? Extant approaches to automated text analysis assume that the meaning of words can be inferred by examining co-occurrence relations (the bag-of-words approach) and formal semantic relationships among words (the linguistics approach). However, a large body of work illustrates that meaning is multimodal; i.e. words gain their meaning through their use in embodied multimodal contexts as labels that refer to “sensory images” – a property of meaning long known to artists, as in the use of visual imagery to inspire linguistically-mediated interpretations in the domain of painting, or in the use of words to evoke mental representations of sensory images in the domain of poetry. Here we propose a method for automated textual analysis that clusters words not based on text-to-text relations, but rather, in text-to-image relations, based on the structure of the sensory images associated with words. Specifically, we develop an automated approach for using large-scale search data from Google to retrieve a continuous set of images associated with search terms, and we provide information-theoretic measures for clustering search terms based on similarities in the color profile (such as ‘palette’) of . We explore how this clustering method can reveal novel dimensions of meaning previously unavailable through purely text-based methods of automated text analysis, for example, by finding unexpected similarities among search terms based on their color profile, or by providing novel measures for how abstract a word is based on the diversity of images associated with its use as a search term.",,Computing; Social and behavioural science,6,Mark Chu,,Arts,"Mark Chu is an Australian painter who shows internationally.
