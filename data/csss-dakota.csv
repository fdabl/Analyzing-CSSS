"""Mom made me do it"" - The evolution of division of labor via maternal manipulation",In this project we build and analyzed an agent-based model of the evolution of division of labor via maternal manipulation.,Social Science,Social and behavioural science,2,Mareen Hofman,Mathematics,Mathematics and statistics,"Hi,
I am just starting my PhD in mathematics at the Free University 
(FU) Berlin and at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in 
Germany. My general research interests lie at the interface between 
mathematics and research on global environmental change with a special 
focus on investigating and understanding transitions in complex 
socio-economic and ecological systems. In my PhD project, I want to 
investigate the role of small random perturbations in the behavior of 
individual agents on the emergent behavior of (economic) agent-based 
models. 
I studied mathematics and environmental management at the FU 
Berlin and at McGill University, Montreal (Canada). In my Master's 
thesis I developed a formal linguistic description of the concept 
'resilience'. The past year, I was working at PIK within the EU project 
'ADAM - Adaptation and Mitigation Strategies' on a meta-analysis about 
climate change impacts, vulnerability and adaptation. 
I like running in the morning, (Anusara) Yoga, and literature. I 
am also looking forward very much to do some hiking tours at the 
weekends! My email address: mareen.hofmann at pik-potsdam.de

little bit more of what would amount to a minor in mathematics.
I tend to like better the pure mathematics approach rather than the applied math approach.

",Linguistics,Humanities,5,Giovanni Petri,"Engineering, Mathematics","Engineering and engineering trades, Mathematics and statistics","Hello there, 
formalities first: I am Giovanni Petri, PhD student at the Centre for Transport Studies and the Complexity and Networks group at Imperial College London, my advisors being Prof. J. W. Polak on the engineering side and Prof. H. J. Jensen on the math one. 
You can drop me a Terry Pratchett quote at  gpetri@imperial.ac.uk or click here for the ugly site, or  here for my (slightly better) homepage;
 my  battle with wordpress  for graphic supremacy is ongoing: the site 
is in the making and soonish there might be something resembling a list 
of projects. 
Chit chat now: 
I've always been fascinated by shapes, pattern and regularities, 
belonging to math, the real world or even just ways of thinking. So I 
ended up studying physics to (try and) make sense of all that. I 
completed my MSc in Theoretical Physics with a  thesis about primordial 
structure formation during Inflation, basically the Universe's wrinkles.
 As I was going through it turned out that what thrilled me had a lot in
 common with many issues in complex systems, statistical mechanics and 
the such. 
Making a long story short, I am working on the interfacing of 
information and transportation networks. It looks a long way to go from 
cosmology but -in truth- it’s not. The goal of identifying and 
characterizing extremely non-trivial and involved spatio-temporal 
patterns in a changing space from simple rules can be applied to both 
fields equally well.
Consider, for instance, a model of a traffic network, where cars 
circulate, coupled to an information network, where information 
diffuses. The population on a node influences the        informational state of
 the corresponding node in the information layer. The latter modifies 
the rules by which the cars go around.
What is happening is that you have a bunch of particles changing the 
landscape they are moving in, while the landscape defines where they are
 going to move next. Beyond the technicalities, the picture is not very 
different from early universe particles moving around according to a 
metric, that they contribute to modify as they move.
And if you find some self-organization, then that becomes VERY exciting!
  
Going back to the mundane, I live of short, very strong 
obsessions and these over the years encompassed basketball, tennis, 
squash, football, guitar (still trying, still failing), reading (lots!),
 trekking, video games (Eve Online for the converts), parkour and 
Capoeira. 
The last one, having lasted for quite a while now, is the exception that
 confirms the rule. Also, since there are so many climbers I wouldn't 
mind getting a crash course. No, wait, bad phrasing...
With languages I am slightly better than the average Italian, 
meaning that I can communicate in English, snore in French, had some 
pretty unsettling ""lost in translation"" experiences in German and sing 
(badly) in (poor) Portuguese.  
Oh and in London I'm trying to pick up  British accent and 
self-deprecating humor.

be understood from the context of complex networks.
I have been working in a highly inter-disciplined group underProf. Li Baowen,

come from different background, such as physics, biology, electronic 
engineering, and material science and engineering … I really enjoy such 
academic atmosphere and it is why I am so enthusiastic to join Santa 
Fe’s summer school.
In the past two years, when i done my master at University of Science and Technology of China(USTC),I
 have used the physics approach such as the concept of Anderson 
localization, structure entropy etc  to study the dynamics of complex 
network, and have already done the works "" Localizations on complex networks"" and something about fractal.
I hope I can work with people from different background to study a
 common interested problem from different approaches from this summer 
school, so that I will learn to look the same problem from different 
angles, and of course, I will see  how my physics background can be used
 to solve other relevant problems.
In addition to research, I love life, love to boil soup (included
 red beans, black beans.....) and cook delicious meals according to 
recipes from the traditional Chinese medicine.  I am also very amazing 
about the foot reflexology.

Agent-based modeling of fluidic self-assembly,I am building a home-made agent-based physical simulator of fluidic self-assembly for micro/nanoelectronical devices.

The proposed framework may constitute the first step in the introduction of this new approach to this emerging and challenging electronic manufacturing technique.,"Engineering, Physics",Engineering and engineering trades,1,Massimo Mastrangeli,Engineering,Engineering and engineering trades,"Hey!
I am a 3rd year Italian PhD student at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, in Leuven, Belgium. 
I also belong to Leuven's Interuniversity MicroElectronic Center (IMEC).
My field of research is mesoscopic self-assembly. Specifically, I am 
developing new techniques to improve the packaging and assembly of 
microchip. This (rather dull) task starts to appear exciting once you 
introduce stochastic techniques and self-assembling processes to work it
 out. It seems weird, and even weirder when it works!
Anyway, this was only the n-th trail that lead me to the galaxy of complex systems. This might well be something one wants to report to a psycotherapist.
I started getting interested in complexity by the end of my 
high-school years. At that time, to show my embarassing modesty, I 
wanted to write an interdisciplinary thesis on complexity. Unluckily, 
the boundaries of my books where to narrow to contain my notes (I guess 
someone said this already a few centuries ago), so I decided to change 
topic - I switched to ""space and time"", not sure I simplified my task. 
Anyhow, since then I started pursuing a (mostly self-taught) 
educational path through self-organization, dynamical systems, pattern 
formation, critical phenomena, evolutionary computation, artificial 
intelligence. For my BS thesis, I looked into phase-looked loops, whose 
functionality is built on non-linear dynamics. For my MS thesis, I 
investigated (microelectromechanical) resonators, acquiring a taste for 
these fundamental and ubiquitous objects. Meanwhile, I was feeding on 
books by Kosko, Kauffman, Gell-Mann, Deutsch, Penrose, Barabasi, 
Strogatz, Axelrod and more. I can candidly confess I am still addicted. 
Abusing of crack might be much cheaper.
Finally, I lately realized I probably want (a subset of) this 
stuff to be the leading theme of my future career. So I thought CSSS 
might be the right place to start this private phase transition.
My other interests include playing and composing music, singing in polyphonic choirs, reading, running and write satire and short essays (Italian only, so far).

statistical physics and non-linear dynamics,linguistics and network 
analyses. I am also interested in the history of science as complex 
system. Some time in the future I would love to take a closer look at 
cell signaling, neuroscience, cognitive science and biophysics. I enjoy 
reading urtexts from the era when science was called natural philosophy 
and when the earlier attempt of the complexity approach still reined. 
I decided to embark on scientific career at the age of 12 by 
joining an astronomy club in my hometown, which led me eventually to 
studying theoretical physics with specialization in astrophysics and to 
working in one of the biggest in Europe (and I believe the best :)) 
astrophysical observatories. For my past participation in astronomical 
expeditions to some hard-accessible regions of the world I was accepted 
this year into the New York chapter of the Explorers club  ""http://www.explorers.org/"".
My experience in the Observatory included both collecting data, 
by making observations on the 2.6 m diameter optical telescope (with 
especially unforgettable long cold winter nights when sky is especially 
clear), and analysing the data via building quantitative models of 
stellar atmospheres and computer experiments. Multi-skilled requirements
 for a scientist and interdisciplinary approach were essential for the 
Observatory's reseach culture, triggering my interest in complex 
systems.
I also developed interest in linguistics and learned English, 
Italian and Greek in addition to my native Russian, thus taking samples 
out of four different language groups of the Indo-European family. 
Currently, I am planning to add Sanskrit to my collection and I am very 
interested in the quantitative approach to the problem of 
proto-languages. I also have a long-standing interest in comparative 
mythology, which probably every astrophysicist necessarily develops via 
wondering about the origin of constellations. Some time in the future I 
would love to take a closer look at the paleoclimatology and at the 
links uniting all these seemingly different fields of study.
After realizing the extend of the power of economic forces over 
the life of societies and over the life of scientific networks and how, 
in fact, little understood and developed this branch of science is, I 
went to New York to study quantitative finance, got some financial 
markets experience and attended since autumn 2006 the New York 
Quantitative Finance seminar, thus getting the first-row-seat 
observation point at the financial crisis of 2008 and at the attempts to
 analyze it.
I would say that my biggest interest at this point is in the ways
 to develop new quantitative risk measures applicable to the global 
financial markets, perhaps by applying the methods of network analysis. 
In addition, I am interested in studies of sustainability of 
companies, cities and societies as complex adaptive systems, in studies 
of information flow in complex networks and in the studies of how the 
dynamics of the knowledge diffusion affects technologies and innovation.
 I'm interested in the quantitative studies of what causes instability 
and collapses of the financial markets and societies as complex 
networks. Perhaps it's good time to apply what we have learned from hard
 sciences to find a sound way towards stability and optimization, which 
would in turn allow us to concentrate on our Das Glasperlenspiel. At 
least, that's the idea.
Im my free time I enjoy hiking and running.

techniques to understand complex systems.  My doctoral work has focused 
on neuroscience however my interests are much more broad. Many fields 
such as economics and ecology where there are interesting questions 
concerning the behavioral prediction of complicated systems are 
interesting to me.    
I am currently a Ph.D. Student in Computational Neuroscience at 
the University of California, San Diego and the Salk Institute for 
Biological Studies.  I will be graduating this winter.  My thesis work 
is focused on quantitatively characterizing neural arbor shape in terms 
of probability density functions.  Because fitting a function to a 
neural arbor is hard, I measure the moments of the arbors directly from 3
 dimensionally reconstructed neurons (A probability density function can
 be described by it's moments).  Investigation of neural arbor moments 
reveal that arbors are statistically self similar to one another.  
Statistical self similarity reveals that neural arbors density functions
 have the same basic shape.  It also reveals the  parameters that are 
needed to characterize the probability density function of an arbor.  I 
investigate different pre-classified types of arbors in terms of these 
parameters and show that there are differences between different types 
of arbors but there is a lot of overlap between them.
My thesis work has involved techniques from neuroscience, physics
 (derivation of scaling relationship in arbors), biostatistics & 
machine learning (data analysis, probability density estimation, cluster
 analysis), data mining (extracting information from a large data base 
of neurons), signal processing (spike train analysis) and experimental 
electrophysiology (measuring ion channel conductances).
As far as projects go I am pretty flexible.  I would generally be
 interested in exploring an astronomy, economics, or ecology problem.  
In terms of a very specific problem I would be interested in thinking 
about how to fit functions to high dimensional data--such as high 
dimensional maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), or comparisons between 
high dimensional data sets.

I'm excited to meet you all shortly and I am happy to 
be part of this group.  I became interested in the subject through 
undergraduate and graduate research on environmental change and the 
implications for social systems.  I recently graduated from the 
University for Peace (in Costa Rica) where I did my MA in Environmental 
Security and Peace.  My thesis used complex systems theories to explore 
the types of management structures used for measurement and evaluation 
of environmental peacemaking programs.  I generally found that the 
organizational structures were too rigid to sustain long-term programs. 
 I think I really became interested in the topic when I picked up Panarchy
 by Gunderson and Holling.  This book influenced the way I thought about
 organization and change in the environment (excluding humans) and the 
similarities that can be drawn to social systems.  Also, the Complex Forest
 by Carol Colfer, was a great example of trying to apply the theories 
through participatory action research.  I am now finishing up work with 
an international development organization where I was helping to build 
robust, multi-stakeholder development programs that could withstand 
perturbations in the economic, political, and social arenas.
There are several things that I would like to look at during this summer program:

How complex adaptive systems modeling can better inform environmental peacemaking initiatives;Social system hierarchies and points where change can occur;The differences between systems that move towards optimization and those that move towards improvement;Creating Boolean functions that reflect an adaptive approach to environmental management and the constraints in doing so;and a larger interest of mine is how does spirituality fit into all of this?
My expertise will come mostly from my background in real-world 
applications of complex adaptive systems theories.  I hope that by the 
end of the summer I will have a better sense of how CS could provide 
alternative management systems for environmental peacemaking projects.  I
 am also eager to learn about how people in other fields will view and 
use this knowledge.  I do not have a concrete idea for a project just 
yet but I am looking forward to coming up with projects in such an 
interdisciplinary group.

 CSSS sounds like an exciting opportunity for an interdisciplinary 
exchange of ideas.  
After completing my doctorate in particle physics, I started 
postdocing in ecology.  It's fun to leave reductionism behind and 
embrace complexity.  I expect CSSS will provide a broad overview of 
approaches to complex systems across the disciplines.  I hope to leave 
with a toolbox of modeling techniques relevant to ecology.
Project ideas:  I would like to continue some research on 
applications of ""sloppy modeling"" (Brown and Sethna, 2003) to food webs.
  I also have an interest in the possibility of adapting lattice models 
from statistical mechanics to macroecology (Volkov, Banavar, and 
Maritan, 2004).
I am currently a postdoc in Tim Keitt's lab at UT.  In August, I'll move to Bill Fagan's lab at UMD.

My research interests and activities include both, 
process-oriented and applied research on natural hazards and risk. One 
special focus is on the spatial and temporal evolution of risk and I 
conducted studies on the variability of natural hazard processes as well
 as of values at risk.
I believe that one of the fundamental reasons for the lack of 
progress regarding natural hazard risk is the continuing separation of 
the research on natural processes and social processes without 
considering interaction between these systems. Therefore, an objective 
is to develop more balanced analyses of risks associated with the 
interaction of socio-economic and geophysical processes.
My current research places emphasis to develop a conceptual model
 for coupled human-landscape systems in alpine regions to achieve more 
insights in the two-way interaction between landscape and human systems.

tool for this integrative research.

achieve a nonzero average velocity through breaking of spatial and/or 
temporal symmetry. For example, a particle in a sawtooth potential 
(which is flat on average) under the influence of an additional 
oscillating force (zero on average) which through the combination of 
these forces moves on average in one direction. Such a ratchet could be 
implemented in lots of different areas, but historically the one people 
were focusing on were (processive) molecular motors like myosin-V and 
kinesin which also move without any net bias telling them which way to 
go.
This got me onto molecular motors. I'm not really looking at them
 in a ratchet sense any more. What I have is access to some 
single-molecule time series for their motion (nm in space and us in 
time!), trying to convert this data into an effective equation motion in
 order to uncover details about its dynamics and mechanical structure, 
and comparing against simulations another collaborator is doing.
Is this complex systems? Probably not. I'm looking at everything 
in a rather reductionist manner. In fact, despite having attended some 
other complex systems events, I still don't really know what complex 
systems are. That's one reason I applied to come to the summer school! 
The other reason is that, as you can hopefully tell from the above, I'm 
interested in interdisciplinary work. These sorts of events, and Santa 
Fe in particular, seem to be where people of a like mind tend to hang 
out, so let's meet up and do some collaborating! -- even if it's not 
necessarily on complex systems.
Outside of work, among other things I'm keen on outdoor 
activities, mainly bushwalking (which you'd call hiking or backpacking, I
 think). I'd like to do some while at Santa Fe, it sounds like a great 
place for it. I also try to do some campaigning on climate change and 
sustainability, and even recently managed to make this overlap with my 
scientific interests, giving part of a public lecture on nonlinearities 
and feedbacks in climate.

How do organisms trade off movement in space (e.g. migration) and in time (e.g. dormancy)?Why and how do organisms synchronize their behavior?How do organisms balance different types of information (e.g. personal, social, genetic) when making decisions?How are groups formed and to what extent to individual retain their identity within a group?How does individual variation result in different behavioral strategies being used?

Human Mobility in an Online World,"Massive multiplayer online games provide a fascinating new way of

with measures of simulated random walkers on the same topology. Player 
mobility is highly different from the mobility of unbiased random

","Social Science,",Social and behavioural science,4,Giovanni Petri,"Engineering, Mathematics","Engineering and engineering trades, Mathematics and statistics","Hello there, 
formalities first: I am Giovanni Petri, PhD student at the Centre for Transport Studies and the Complexity and Networks group at Imperial College London, my advisors being Prof. J. W. Polak on the engineering side and Prof. H. J. Jensen on the math one. 
You can drop me a Terry Pratchett quote at  gpetri@imperial.ac.uk or click here for the ugly site, or  here for my (slightly better) homepage;
 my  battle with wordpress  for graphic supremacy is ongoing: the site 
is in the making and soonish there might be something resembling a list 
of projects. 
Chit chat now: 
I've always been fascinated by shapes, pattern and regularities, 
belonging to math, the real world or even just ways of thinking. So I 
ended up studying physics to (try and) make sense of all that. I 
completed my MSc in Theoretical Physics with a  thesis about primordial 
structure formation during Inflation, basically the Universe's wrinkles.
 As I was going through it turned out that what thrilled me had a lot in
 common with many issues in complex systems, statistical mechanics and 
the such. 
Making a long story short, I am working on the interfacing of 
information and transportation networks. It looks a long way to go from 
cosmology but -in truth- it’s not. The goal of identifying and 
characterizing extremely non-trivial and involved spatio-temporal 
patterns in a changing space from simple rules can be applied to both 
fields equally well.
Consider, for instance, a model of a traffic network, where cars 
circulate, coupled to an information network, where information 
diffuses. The population on a node influences the        informational state of
 the corresponding node in the information layer. The latter modifies 
the rules by which the cars go around.
What is happening is that you have a bunch of particles changing the 
landscape they are moving in, while the landscape defines where they are
 going to move next. Beyond the technicalities, the picture is not very 
different from early universe particles moving around according to a 
metric, that they contribute to modify as they move.
And if you find some self-organization, then that becomes VERY exciting!
  
Going back to the mundane, I live of short, very strong 
obsessions and these over the years encompassed basketball, tennis, 
squash, football, guitar (still trying, still failing), reading (lots!),
 trekking, video games (Eve Online for the converts), parkour and 
Capoeira. 
The last one, having lasted for quite a while now, is the exception that
 confirms the rule. Also, since there are so many climbers I wouldn't 
mind getting a crash course. No, wait, bad phrasing...
With languages I am slightly better than the average Italian, 
meaning that I can communicate in English, snore in French, had some 
pretty unsettling ""lost in translation"" experiences in German and sing 
(badly) in (poor) Portuguese.  
Oh and in London I'm trying to pick up  British accent and 
self-deprecating humor.

organization itself as well as its relationship with the broader business community. This is
manifested in generic scaling laws that indicate that organizations that participate in a
business/economic ecology did not evolve, grow and adapt either ""randomly"" or in a planned
controlled manner but were subject to dynamical laws. From a research perspective we
view Boeing as a ""case study"" by providing data and significant support for the research.
The project will be focused on understanding these big questions by seeking to reveal the
underlying principles, constraints and dynamics independent of the details by which
companies grow and evolve driven by innovation (their ""coarse-grained behavior"").

Local and nonlocal information in a traffic network: how important is the horizon?,"Recent advances in distributed sensor network technology have changed
 the landscape of traffic optimization in which small, mobile devices 
are able to sense local information and communicate in real time with 
one another.  Naive optimization algorithms that operate solely on the 
local or global level are inherently flawed, as global optimization 
requires every local sensor to communicate with a centralized 
base-station, creating prohibitive bandwidth, robustness, and security 
concerns, while local optimization methods are limited by a near 
information horizon as they are unable to propagate or react to 
information beyond their immediate vicinity.  This paper investigates an
 intermediate approach where individual sensors are able to propagate 
congestion information over a variable distance that is determined in 
real-time.  This strategy consistently out-performs a naive strategy 
where every car simply takes the shortest path to its destination, but 
does worse than a simpler optimization algorithm that only incorporates 
local information.  This is most likely because the intermediate 
solution directs cars along the same alternate path when attempting to 
free a congested area, thus creating new congestion along the detour. 
The results suggest that local information might set an upper bound on 
performance in models of cascading information.  Further work is 
required to confirm this observation and develop an algorithm able to 
join both local and global information to effectively diffuse traffic

formalities first: I am Giovanni Petri, PhD student at the Centre for Transport Studies and the Complexity and Networks group at Imperial College London, my advisors being Prof. J. W. Polak on the engineering side and Prof. H. J. Jensen on the math one. 
You can drop me a Terry Pratchett quote at  gpetri@imperial.ac.uk or click here for the ugly site, or  here for my (slightly better) homepage;
 my  battle with wordpress  for graphic supremacy is ongoing: the site 
is in the making and soonish there might be something resembling a list 
of projects. 
Chit chat now: 
I've always been fascinated by shapes, pattern and regularities, 
belonging to math, the real world or even just ways of thinking. So I 
ended up studying physics to (try and) make sense of all that. I 
completed my MSc in Theoretical Physics with a  thesis about primordial 
structure formation during Inflation, basically the Universe's wrinkles.
 As I was going through it turned out that what thrilled me had a lot in
 common with many issues in complex systems, statistical mechanics and 
the such. 
Making a long story short, I am working on the interfacing of 
information and transportation networks. It looks a long way to go from 
cosmology but -in truth- it’s not. The goal of identifying and 
characterizing extremely non-trivial and involved spatio-temporal 
patterns in a changing space from simple rules can be applied to both 
fields equally well.
Consider, for instance, a model of a traffic network, where cars 
circulate, coupled to an information network, where information 
diffuses. The population on a node influences the        informational state of
 the corresponding node in the information layer. The latter modifies 
the rules by which the cars go around.
What is happening is that you have a bunch of particles changing the 
landscape they are moving in, while the landscape defines where they are
 going to move next. Beyond the technicalities, the picture is not very 
different from early universe particles moving around according to a 
metric, that they contribute to modify as they move.
And if you find some self-organization, then that becomes VERY exciting!
  
Going back to the mundane, I live of short, very strong 
obsessions and these over the years encompassed basketball, tennis, 
squash, football, guitar (still trying, still failing), reading (lots!),
 trekking, video games (Eve Online for the converts), parkour and 
Capoeira. 
The last one, having lasted for quite a while now, is the exception that
 confirms the rule. Also, since there are so many climbers I wouldn't 
mind getting a crash course. No, wait, bad phrasing...
With languages I am slightly better than the average Italian, 
meaning that I can communicate in English, snore in French, had some 
pretty unsettling ""lost in translation"" experiences in German and sing 
(badly) in (poor) Portuguese.  
Oh and in London I'm trying to pick up  British accent and 
self-deprecating humor.

Parallel Agent Based Models,"Agent based models (ABMs) are characterized by purposive intelligent 
agents which interact to yield complex emergent behaviors.  While each 
agent operates with an autonomous localized set of rules, these rules 
typically involve interactions among agents and with the agents’ 
environment, presenting challenges when attempting to simulate very 
large populations of agents.  At the same time, the scaling properties 
of complex adaptive systems are such that it is important to study the 
properties of an ABM over wide ranges of population size.  This is 
because the emergent properties of a system typically change with scope 
and scale: mammalian basal metabolic rate scales sublinearly with animal
 mass, and incidence of crime in a city scales superlinearly with city

My B.A. dissertation was on foundational issues in ontology and I am 
still spending part of my life convincing myself that I do not exist. In
 my M.A. dissertation I’d like to shed some new light on the concept of 
“complexity” borrowing tools from formal ontology and philosophical 
logic. I strongly feel that a qualitative theory of information is 
needed to make sense of how complexity emerges from low-level 
simplicity, but unfortunately I now have just some vague clues of how 
such a theory may look like. I hope CSSS will help me figuring out if 
all this work makes more sense than the previous one.

Revolutionary fervor spreads through the network like a contagion, but

arrange actors along a continuum, allowing for counter-revolutionaries

crucial condition for successful revolutions, which is too often

A first milestone has been the Brussels conference ""Complexity: Friend or Foe?"". in December 2009, at which Geoffrey West from Santa Fe was the keynote speaker. More info and some Youtube video clips can be found here.

Right now I am preparing the launch of a new company that will steer, manage and execute the ""complexity program"" in the coming years. Initial projects will study complex phenomena such as obesity in Asia, adoption of smart textiles, strategy formulation and business performance in industrial organizations. Additionally we will launch a series of complexity and systems thinking based education programs for decision takers and managers, and we will work together with Belgian education institutes to disseminate insights from complexity science to students. Furthermore we aim to set-up a virtual platform to bring complexity specialists into contact with owners of complex problems, in order to develop relevant solution scenario's.

I've been for the last 5 years or so. I moved to Davis (near Sacramento)
 in 2007 from San Francisco to start a PhD in Applied Mathematics.
My academic interests are in dynamical networks, particularly 
ones that resemble our brains in some abstract way. I studied 
neuroscience at MIT as an undergrad, motivated by the prospects of 
replicating intelligence in machines and understanding a bit better this
 very machine that is currently constructing this silly self-referential
 sentence. 
Here's a few beliefs I have;

We have a lot to learn from nature, and biology in specific. 
It's had several billion years to get its act together and its latest 
presentation is quite impressive.Brains are only one example of a wide class of complex networks 
which can compute things or otherwise act ""intelligently"".  Nature found
 one path, but it doesn't mean there aren't a whole host of other ones. 
What's common between various classes of these networks?By studying the neurophisiologicafunctional basis of animal 
intelligence, I think humans can hope to help humanity in at least a 
couple of ways:
Contributing to our own self knowledge.  There are some pretty 
simple lessons that have had deep impacts on my life when looked at 
through certain glasses. Let me give you an example. Donald Hebb
 one of the first greats in theoretical neuroscience proposed that 
""neurons that fire together wire together."" Over the last 60 years this 
has been repeatedly verified empirically. If you think about it, what it
 means is that whatever perceptions or behaviors you are partaking in at
 the same time will later become more likely to occur simultaneously. 
This is enormously powerful once we understand it.  It means we can work
 to break ourselves of old habits and form new patterns of behavior that
 serve our lives.Building machines that do menial or repetitive tasks for us.  Face 
it, you want a robot to drive you around. Or to go find you a bunch of 
cool new music that you probably will like.
I've enjoyed reading about the specifics of people's academic work on
 here, so why don't I just plagiarize myself briefly and copy over a 
paragraph from my CSSS application which summarizes my academic self as 
well as anything:


I want to understand intelligent perception and behavior by building,
 analyzing and finding patterns in and characteristics of complex 
dynamical networks. The central question I am interested in addressing 
is: given a mathematical description for internal as well as intra-node 
dynamics, how do patterns in the structural topology of a dynamical 
network predictably give rise to patterns in its functional behavior. Or
 more compactly: how does structure map to function of a network?


This
 is a recent project I completed on studying the ways in which networks 
of spiking neurons can generate interesting patterns. It probably raised
 more questions for me than I answered, but perhaps thats a good thing?

scientists have put a lot of work into the investigation of residential,
 friendship, trust, exchange or discussion networks, scientific inquiry 
has typically limited itself to investigating the characteristics of 
networks of only one kind. This approach has produced plentiful insight 
on the structure and function of different kinds of social networks, but
 the interaction between the different kinds of social networks has 
received insufficient investigation so far. Our work, in which we 
examine the interaction of residential and social networks represents an
 attempt at advancing this field of inquiry. More specifically, we 
extend a classic model of residential segregation (Schelling, 1968) by 
incorporating a social network that constructs -- and is influenced by 
-- residential preferences. We use Agent-Based Modelling to examine how 
social network topology affects residential segregation in the Schelling
 model. Given its current popularity in social simulation, extending the
 Schelling model is an important task in its own right, but we seek to 
achieve something more fundamental than a mere rehashing of an old 
model. We deploy Schelling's model as the basis for a way to understand 
multiplex networks, and seek to give a formal, methodologically 
practicable expression to Granovetter's concept of embeddedness. 
Attached here is just the first half of our working paper, and we'll 
upload the complete version soon.

new profile picture and answers to Dan’s questions as they are posted in
 the homepage. 


I am student of philosophy at San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy. I 
am a jr. researcher in “Experimental and Applied Epistemology”  @ CRESA,  and a jr. researcher in “Life-Span Extension Methodologies” @ iLabs. I am currently figuring out what these strange tags actually mean. 


My B.A. dissertation was on foundational issues in ontology and I am 
still spending part of my life convincing myself that I do not exist. In
 my M.A. dissertation I’d like to shed some new light on the concept of 
“complexity” borrowing tools from formal ontology and philosophical 
logic. I strongly feel that a qualitative theory of information is 
needed to make sense of how complexity emerges from low-level 
simplicity, but unfortunately I now have just some vague clues of how 
such a theory may look like. I hope CSSS will help me figuring out if 
all this work makes more sense than the previous one. 


'simplex sigillum veri' has always been my favorite motto since my first
 B.A. year, but I think I’ll switch to 'complex sigillum veri' before

I am a 3rd year Italian PhD student at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, in Leuven, Belgium. 
I also belong to Leuven's Interuniversity MicroElectronic Center (IMEC).
My field of research is mesoscopic self-assembly. Specifically, I am 
developing new techniques to improve the packaging and assembly of 
microchip. This (rather dull) task starts to appear exciting once you 
introduce stochastic techniques and self-assembling processes to work it
 out. It seems weird, and even weirder when it works!
Anyway, this was only the n-th trail that lead me to the galaxy of complex systems. This might well be something one wants to report to a psycotherapist.
I started getting interested in complexity by the end of my 
high-school years. At that time, to show my embarassing modesty, I 
wanted to write an interdisciplinary thesis on complexity. Unluckily, 
the boundaries of my books where to narrow to contain my notes (I guess 
someone said this already a few centuries ago), so I decided to change 
topic - I switched to ""space and time"", not sure I simplified my task. 
Anyhow, since then I started pursuing a (mostly self-taught) 
educational path through self-organization, dynamical systems, pattern 
formation, critical phenomena, evolutionary computation, artificial 
intelligence. For my BS thesis, I looked into phase-looked loops, whose 
functionality is built on non-linear dynamics. For my MS thesis, I 
investigated (microelectromechanical) resonators, acquiring a taste for 
these fundamental and ubiquitous objects. Meanwhile, I was feeding on 
books by Kosko, Kauffman, Gell-Mann, Deutsch, Penrose, Barabasi, 
Strogatz, Axelrod and more. I can candidly confess I am still addicted. 
Abusing of crack might be much cheaper.
Finally, I lately realized I probably want (a subset of) this 
stuff to be the leading theme of my future career. So I thought CSSS 
might be the right place to start this private phase transition.
My other interests include playing and composing music, singing in polyphonic choirs, reading, running and write satire and short essays (Italian only, so far).

","Economics, Geography",Social and behavioural science,3,Jacopo Tagliabue,Philosophy,Humanities,"Hi all,


 
This is “my profile release 2.0”, including exciting updates such as a 
new profile picture and answers to Dan’s questions as they are posted in
 the homepage. 


I am student of philosophy at San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy. I 
am a jr. researcher in “Experimental and Applied Epistemology”  @ CRESA,  and a jr. researcher in “Life-Span Extension Methodologies” @ iLabs. I am currently figuring out what these strange tags actually mean. 


My B.A. dissertation was on foundational issues in ontology and I am 
still spending part of my life convincing myself that I do not exist. In
 my M.A. dissertation I’d like to shed some new light on the concept of 
“complexity” borrowing tools from formal ontology and philosophical 
logic. I strongly feel that a qualitative theory of information is 
needed to make sense of how complexity emerges from low-level 
simplicity, but unfortunately I now have just some vague clues of how 
such a theory may look like. I hope CSSS will help me figuring out if 
all this work makes more sense than the previous one. 


'simplex sigillum veri' has always been my favorite motto since my first
 B.A. year, but I think I’ll switch to 'complex sigillum veri' before 
CSSS.

Geography and Regional Research of the University Vienna, Austria.
My research interests and activities include both, 
process-oriented and applied research on natural hazards and risk. One 
special focus is on the spatial and temporal evolution of risk and I 
conducted studies on the variability of natural hazard processes as well
 as of values at risk.
I believe that one of the fundamental reasons for the lack of 
progress regarding natural hazard risk is the continuing separation of 
the research on natural processes and social processes without 
considering interaction between these systems. Therefore, an objective 
is to develop more balanced analyses of risks associated with the 
interaction of socio-economic and geophysical processes.
My current research places emphasis to develop a conceptual model
 for coupled human-landscape systems in alpine regions to achieve more 
insights in the two-way interaction between landscape and human systems.
 In this context the implications of complexity theory are a promising 
tool for this integrative research.
I am looking forward to meeting you soon and I hope we will have a lot of interesting discussion on complex systems.

Research Interest
My research is mainly focused on complex networks and their use 
to understand the propagation dynamics of infectious diseases in human 
populations. More specifically, I work on developing and/or improving 
mathematical formalisms describing the bond percolation of complex 
networks. I am also interested in Information Theory and Bayesian 
Inference, although I have not done serious research about it. Finally, I
 find interdisciplinary research, in general, very motivating.


Expertise

Network Science and Graph TheoryProgramming: C++, Matlab/GNU Octave, LaTeXLinux (Ubuntu) and Open Source Softwares in general


Expectations
I approach my CSSS experience with an open mind. I simply hope to
 learn much about other aspects of Complexity Science. I would however 
be glad if some of the concepts learned at CSSS could influence my 
future research.


Projects
I do not have anything specific in mind. It would be great if I could deepen my knowledge on a new subject via this project.

information, communication and knowledge in society. I'm particularly 
interested in the implications of and requisites for the digitization of
 information in complex social systems. Topic-wise that can cover the 
fields of communication, economic development, political science, public

Before joining USC, I was working at the United Nations Regional Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean for ten years, where I created and coordinated the Information Society Program,
 which basically looks at how information and communication technologies
 can be used for development. The work at this UN Regional Commission is
 similar to the work of a consultancy company, just that your clients 
are not businesses, but the governments of the region. During this time I
 had the chance to provide hands-on technical assistance to Heads of 
States, government officials, legislators, diplomats, and civil society 
organizations in 27 countries. Exciting times, but as a result of this 
intense experience I realized how much the related discussion could 
benefit from a more solid theoretical and empirical grounding. So I took
 a temporary sabbatical from my responsibilities with the UN and joined USC Annenberg School of Communication
 in search for analytical frameworks and contributions to this 
challenge. The same challenge brings me now here to the Santa Fe

,,,,,Nadja Kunz,Some engineering thing,Engineering and engineering trades,"Who am I?   I'm a PhD scholar at the University of Queensland,
 Australia.  My thesis seeks to understand behaviour (principally 
performance and resilience) in coupled human-engineered systems.  I 
contend that a lack of understanding about the interactions between 
these systems is a major barrier to sustainability implementation in the
 industrial sector.  My research context is water management within the 
minerals industry.  I'm adopting a systems modelling approach to study 
engineered systems, combined with social network analysis to look at 
human systems.  Building on Ashby’s law of requisite variety, I 
hypothesise that performance of the coupled system will be best when 
human and engineered systems are aligned according to their complexity. 
 I will test this hypothesis through gathering empirical data from case 
study sites.  
I’m supervised cross-faculty by Prof Chris Moran at the 
Sustainable Minerals Institute and Dr Tim Kastelle at the UQ Business 
School.  My own background is in Chemical Engineering/Business 
Management.  
What expertise can I bring to the group?   It looks like 
I'm the only Australian in the group, so I shall bring with me different
 experiences and perspectives.  In particular, I’ve had a lot of 
practical experience working at a number of industrial sites (during and
 post my undergrad degree) including a copper mine, alumina refinery, 
paper mill, oil refinery, and an ammonia/urea plant.  I have a solid 
understanding of sustainability and the practical challenges associated 
with its implementation in the industrial sector.  I look forward to 
some engaging in some insightful discussions with others who have 
interests in this field. 
Through my PhD I'm developing a good understanding of the various
 statistical models available to analyse social network data.  The 
programs I've been using so far are UCINET and Netdraw, and I intend to 
use PNet down the track to investigate the factors driving network 
evolution.   
What do I hope to get out of CSSS?     I'm excited about 
all of the modules!  I’m particularly eager to learn about structure and
 dynamics across multi-scale networks and to advance my understanding of
 network emergence, resilience and robustness.  I also look forward to 
exploring approaches to conceptualize (and hopefully measure!) 
complexity in an empirical context, and to learn about novel approaches 
for validating models of complex systems. 
Possible projects  I'll have a think about this...  But it
 could be interesting to do a project investigating sustainability 
challenges across different political and/or industrial regions, drawing
 on the diversity of scholars' experiences.  Perhaps an investigation 
into the challenges of meeting multi-objectives across diverse 
industrial, governance and societal systems?  
Interests?    If you’ve explored the SFI Facebook page, 
you’ll probably have noticed that I enjoy sports – soccer, rock 
climbing, cycling, tennis, netball, yoga, surfing, running, etc.  I love
 being outdoors, getting out to the beach, bushwalking, hiking.  Also 
love travelling.  I’m excited to share so many common interests with 
other scholars and look forward to exploring the beautiful Santa Fe 
region with the group over summer.  
In other interests, I’ve been involved in a few volunteer groups 
over the years – including Engineers Without Borders and some local 
environmental groups in my hometown of Brisbane.  A few years ago I 
volunteered at an indigenous school in Central Australia which was 
life-changing.

,,,,,Victor Quintanar-Zilinskas,"Complex Biological Systems
",Life sciences,"Victor Quintanar-Zilinskas is a graduate student at the University of California, Irvine.  His current research focus,  linked with the experimental results of his collaborators Xiangmin Xu, Ron Frostig, and Raju Metherate, is system-level dynamics and information processing in many-neuron (on the order of 1000s) networks.  His advisors are Zoran Nenadic and SFI faculty member Arthur Lander.
Over the next five years, Victor intends to turn the focus of his
 network modeling to the study of 1) the information-processing 
consequences of the brain's frequent brief episodes of self-organized 
synchrony between groups of neurons 2) the potential for cognitive 
utilization of information generated by complex dynamics (Turing 
patterns are an illustration of such generation); what he will learn 
this summer at SFI
 (from both modules and peers) will be highly applicable to the pursuit 
of these topics.  The latter topic is particularly difficult to study, 
but information-generative modeling and olfactory computation results are likely starting points of reference.
Victor was raised in Palo Alto, CA and his interests and outlooks are heavily influenced by his upbringing in Silicon Valley's technoculture.  He double-majored in math and biology at Santa Clara University
 (class of 2009), where he did his first computational neuroscience 
research, sparking his current interests.  He also worked with Geoffrey Bowker (who was, at the time, at Santa Clara University)
 to characterize the work practices of scholar communities that study 
complex systems (e.g. networks of ecologists that study various facets 
of the same ecosystem); it was while on this project that he developed 
his appreciation for the study of black swan emergence events (e.g. 
shifts between stable states of the composition of an ocean bacteria 
population; large storms).  Victor's current ""applied philosophy"" 
interest is the connections between Constructivism, creativity theory, and interdisciplinarity.
