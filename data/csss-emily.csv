Evolving Social Complexity,,Social Science,Social and behavioral sciences,7,Aaron Frank,Computational Social Science,Social and behavioural sciences,"I am a Ph.D. student in George Mason's Computational Social Science program, and work for BAE Systems. I have spent the last 10 years working on complex national security problems, with a particular emphasis on developing computational methods and analytic tools to explore the theory and history of military revolutions and state failure. My research interest is on the development of an ecological theory of international relations, which seeks to generate an international system composed of state and non-state actors out of boundedly rational agents.

I have a BA in Political Science from Boston University (1997), and an MA in Security Studies from Georgetown University (1999).

Exploring healing strategies on Random Boolean Networks,,Biology?,Life sciences,5,Amitabh Trehan,Computer Science,Computing,"I am working towards a PhD in Computer Science at the University of New Mexico.

My current research is towards developing self-healing algorithms for reconfigurable networks. Reconfigurable networks are networks in which we can add links when needed such as peer-to-peer networks. My advisor Prof. Saia Jared Saia and I are attempting to develop algorithms for efficient reconnections (in terms of some invariants and resource costs) in such networks under attack. We are looking for (and finding) interesting connections in other areas such as electrical circuits and many biological/ecological systems.

Recently, I have also been interested in populations dynamics modelling using coupled differential equations, a project from a NonLinear Dynamics course I took this semester.

I hope to extend these projects during the summer school with the help of enthusiastic experts :)

Otherwise, I am interested in learning about almost everyting around (unless the maths is too complicated!) me and also things in outer space (cosmology). I have an undergraduate degree in Biology. I dabbled a bit in phonetics (and multilingual typesetting (LaTeX), computer codes) too, which formed the subject for my M.Tech. thesis.

I am currently a graduate student at Georgetown University in the Communication, Culture, and Technology Program. I have not chosen a specific topic for my thesis yet, but my interests include the effects of technology on society (both past and present), the problem of information overload in society and how we might create new ways of processing information to make it more manageable, and developing a more interconnected approach to globalization studies that reflects how each element of globalization effects the other. I see complexity theory relating to each of these interests in different ways. With respect to the effects of technology on society, technological innovation and diffusion has followed the traditional S shaped curve and has been shown to mimic the Kondratiev wave. If these patterns are studied more in-depthly it might be possible to make more accurate projections about whether the rate of technological growth and innovation will remain the same or increase in the future. In terms of information overload, I think complexity theory can offer news ways of classifying how ""complex"" a given piece of information is and offer the simplest way of navigating it. Visual simulations of complex information can also offer a new and more easily digestible format, the same way a traditional x-y graph makes it easier to see the behavior and draw conclusions about a function. Finally, up until this point globalization studies have focused on specific parts of globalization such as economics or culture, but there has yet to be an approach that tries to see how all aspects of globalization are connected and effect one another. I think complexity theory offers the best method for trying to synthesize these different areas and creating a more holistic approach, viewing globalization as more of a complex adaptive system. I do not come from a math or computer science background, so my knowledge of each area is very limited. I have been brushing up on calculus and differential equations for the past month and hope that I have learned enough to at least be able to speak the language, but any help from my fellow summer programmers would be greatly appreciated. Also, if there is anyone else in my situation (someone coming from more of a social science/cultural background) I would love to speak with you about how you see complexity theory fitting into your area of interest.

I believe there are lots of fascinating topics--such as strategic alliance, innovation and knowledge diffusion. I studied Computer Science in undergraduate school and I keep to collaborate with students from CS dept., because we face many similar topics,for example, small-world network and scale-free network are important network structures in both social netowrk and information network.

Modeling Therapeutic Intervention In Sepsis,,"Biology, Medicine",Health,2,Mauricio Rosas,Medicine,Health,"My main research interest is related to regulation of inflammation by autonomic nervous system. Specifically, my thesis work addresses the anatomical and molecular pathway by which electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve attenuates systemic inflammation in an animal model of sepsis.

Sepsis is a health issue because of its high incidence, mortality and economical cost. Despite several years of research and clinical trials testing promising drugs, sepsis is considered to be an intractable disease. In part, this is so because current experimental and therapeutic strategies designed to harness inflammation are based on our understanding of a system with linear dynamics. More recently, however, the process of sepsis has been formulated in terms of complexity theory. Bodily organization and function are conceived as an emergent property of a non-linear, non-equilibrium system organized as a scale-free network. Loss of homeostasis in sepsis is perceived as the progression from a stable behavioral pattern or attractor to another characterized by organ dysfunction as a consequence of reduced connectedness between the system’s elements.

My research is the study of wireless sensor networks. In particular, the study of stochastic behaviour of greedy data-routing algorithms, and the effects of implementing stochastic power-consumption schemes. I did my undergrad in physics (when I learnt of the Santa Fe Institute) and some electronic engineering before moving over to applied mathematics. I have some knowledge of stochastic processes, and I have experience with a varied range of applied maths. I do most of my work in Matlab, though I have used Java in the distant past, and plan to do some of my work in C++.

I'd like to simply bounce some research ideas of people. I'd also like to employ agent-based modelling to verify some of our theoretical results. Ideally, I would like to do a small project that entails studying the stochastic effects of a power or routing scheme in a sensor network by using complex system modelling techniques.

My personal interests/activities include: reading, history, science, geography (I have been known to visit wiki from time to time :), movies, travelling, rock-climbing (very occasionally nowadays), playing pool, and having a drink with friends.

But, I have broad interests and am eager to learn more this June about the applications you have for complexity science in your own research, and how this may overlap into issues in mine.

I'm interested in complexity science because I think it might shed some light on some longstanding questions in marine phytoplankton ecology. It seems odd how algae, being photosynthetic, are able to survive in the ocean when their light environment fluctuates so dramatically. Why is it that what works best in the most complex light environment is contained in possibly the most simple photosynthetic organisms. What strategies do phytoplankton employ for survival? How can we learn about these strategies, given the few photosynthetic properties that we can measure in the natural environment?",,Male,Postdoc,Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,USA,2008,Santa Fe,

I am originally from Athens, Greece, where I lived until the age of 18. I did my BA (Hons) at the University of Toronto in Peace and Conflict Studies with Thomas Homer-Dixon and also studied Game Theory under the late Anatol Rapoport. After a brief time at Harvard to pursue the study of Medical Ethics, I returned to Canada for an MA in Political Science with Hudson Meadwell at McGill University in Montreal. Currently, I am doing my PhD in Political Science under Juliet Johnson also at McGill. Specifically, I am looking at recent East European and Post-Soviet mass mobilizations (democratizing ‘revolutions’ like the Serbian ‘Bulldozer’, the Georgian ‘Rose’ and the Ukrainian ‘Orange’ one) and their outcomes from a complex networks’ perspective--in short, politics at the edge of chaos.

Beyond the academic realm, I am a member of the Canadian branch of Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders); my extra-curricular hobbies include painting, basketball, chess, Russian literature and tango. As can be deduced from this bio sketch, I favour inter-disciplinary approaches to intellectual problems and puzzle-solving, and I am looking forward to the Complex System’s school to exchange ideas and learn more about complex systems and dynamic processes.

Spatial Patterns of Segregation: A generative model,,Human Behavior,Social and behavioural sciences,3,Walter Zesk,Architecture,Architecture and building,"I am in the final year of the M.Arch. (Masters of architecture) program at the Rhode Island School of Design. My interest in the study of complex and chaotic systems first emerged as an undergrad at Wesleyan University where I studied philosophy and art. To a philosophy student, the synthetic potential of chemical and biological systems seemed to have significant implications for the major questions of being, progress and intention.

In my thesis as an undergrad I designed a system of floating architecture for boat-dwelling communities in Southeast Asia that could adapt to a variety of uses and mesh with local social customs tied to boat building. After graduation I pursued this interest by working as a boat builder and living on a small sailboat for three years until returning to school at RISD.

At RISD, I am continuing to explore the same interests and develop architecture that is as flexible, dynamic and resilient as the social and ecological systems it is inserted into. I also hope to localize the architecture's effect on its surroundings. The hope is that if people have to look at their trash out the window they will make less trash.",,Male,Student,Rhode Island School of Design,USA,2008,Santa Fe,

Research-wise, I am currently interested in two things: (1) emergence and stability of cooperative or mutually advantageous behavior and (2) decision-making under risk and uncertainty. In particular, I am interested in the application of these two research areas to questions in political philosophy and philosophy of science. For example, how can the design of social and political institutions solve social dilemmas and when is coercion justified? Or, what principles of justice would we choose if we did not know how wealthy our parents will be and what native abilities we will be lucky to have? These intersect with questions in philosophy of science; for example, what probabilistic inferences should we draw from our experiences and was Popper right to be an inductive skeptic? (These questions are, of course, also relevant to epistemology and to statistical learning theory.) From time to time, I also worry about the robustness of computational models. Recently, as a way to intermittently procrastinate while studying for my comps, I have also taken a keen interest in urban planning/geography, especially the relationship between walkability, population density and urban spatial structure. And yes, there is a handful of things I find interesting outside of Geekville too.

Investigating novel phenomena that produce changes in biological pathways between species,,"Ecology, Information Theory",Life sciences,4,Ziya Kalay,Physics,Physical sciences,"Born and raised in Ankara/Turkey, nowadays trying to find my way in the deserts of New Mexico.. And deeply missing the Mediterranean! I acquired my BS in physics from METU in Ankara in 2005, currently I am pursuing a PhD in Physics at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, US. I am interested in statistical physics, nonlinear dynamics and their applications to complex systems. Some of the research projects that I have been involved in are about: Transient dynamics in some diffusion-reaction systems for which the analytic solutions for traveling waves are known, theory of molecular motion on cell membranes based on the compartmentalized structure of the membranes and social network analysis in the context of anthropology and political science. I am also interested in transport phenomena in networks and synchronization in nature. And I am hoping to narrow down my interests soon! In my free time (which has started to approach zero faster than exponentially since I began grad school), I like; playing classical guitar, listening to music in languages that I dont understand, reading, being outdoors and traveling. Looking forward to arriving China!",Turkey,Male,Student,University of New Mexico,USA,2007,Bejing,
