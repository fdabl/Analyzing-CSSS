Complex fishery system in Northern Cameroon,,Ecology,Agriculture and forestry and fishery,7,Sarah Laborde,Ecology,Life sciences,"I am a postdoc at the Ohio State University in the Department of Anthropology, working with an interdisciplinary lab (with these people). Our team is interested in the dynamics of a floodplain in the North of Cameroon, and we are trying to understand the dynamical connections between hydrological (flooding) patterns, fish and vegetation ecology, and social dynamics. One outcome we are working towards is an integrated model of floodplain dynamics to explore possible regime shifts, for example indicators of the possible collapse of the fish population or a transition from relative social cohesion to widespread conflict. Here at the summer school I’m interested to learn about agent-based modeling and nonlinear dynamics in social and ecological systems (amongst many other things).

This project is interdisciplinary and complex in itself. One of my parallel interests, pertaining more to the social studies of science, is the documentation and analysis of the way our lab functions as an interdisciplinary team: basically looking at a group of interdisciplinary scientists as a complex system and seeing how (and what kinds of) ideas emerge in the context of interdisciplinary interactions.",,Female,PostDoc,Ohio State University,United States,51-100,2014,Santa Fe,Kyle,
Swidden agriculture,"Swidden farming in the Toledo district of Belize is a relatively young subsistence agricultural technique in which each farmer enlists help from his friends to clean a patch of land, grow crops, and harvest. The resulting near-reciprocal social network of exchange of agricultural labor constitutes an essential component of the coupled human natural system that operates in this region. This paper describes a preliminary effort to develop an agent-based model of this system, which started as a demonstration model in NetLogo and evolved into 3 candidate models that were evaluated for basic viability criteria to exhibit fundamental features of the Toledo district, such as its characteristic cultivation cycle in which a patch is usually farmed for 2 years at most, then left to fallow for 7 years at least. In our evaluation, we were able to conclude that the 3 proposed models cannot meet the proposed criteria, thus leaving us with the alternative of introducing the cycle as an explicit constraint. We plan to use what we have learned and the tools we have built in the development of future models that produce viable scenarios in order to move on to the study of social properties and emergent phenomena of such models.",,Agriculture and forestry and fishery,3,Lindsay Todman,Engineering,Engineering and engineering trades,"I originally trained as a mechanical engineer but subsequently studied hydrology and then, for my PhD, focused on modelling water flow through soil from a novel irrigation system, which also desalinated the water.

In my research I use models and data analysis to explore how we could better manage agricultural systems. My recent work has particularly focused on the temporal dynamics of these systems and their ‘resilience’ to shocks. As the assumptions necessary in such models mean that can never be ‘right’ I view them as tools that are best used in close collaboration with stakeholders (including other scientists), so that the options identified by the models can inspire further discussion and experimentation.",,Female,Postdoc,Rothamsted Research,United Kingdom,Not University,2016,Santa Fe,Jackie,

An agent-based model of forest use with social learning,"We present an agent based model for deforestation under social learning. We assume a forest is composed of a number of land parcels. Each parcel is in either a forested or a deforested state, and the state transition is described via a two-state Markov chain. Landowners decide whether or not to cut trees based on the relative expected utility of forested and deforested parcels. The expected utility is altered by information input about actual utility, in particular the average experience in a society. We study the global landscape dynamics that result from individual decisions. We observed stationary-forested, stationary-deforested, and cyclic-forested landscapes that are induced by collective deforestation. We investigated feedback from global landscape dynamics to individual decision. We found that if the value of forested land increased with the decline of forest density, collective deforestation was more likely to occur. Extinction of forest ecosystems was predicted if the forest recovery rate was diminished by an intensive deforestation. We discuss the implications for forest policy and management.",Ecology,Agriculture and forestry and fishery,1,Akiko Satake,Ecology,Life sciences,"I am a postdoc in Evolutionary Ecology at Princeton University.

Organic urban boundaries and clusters - analyzing Singapore as an example,"Cities are dynamic complex systems evolving through their functions and human activities. While the regional boundaries are artificially created, dwellers move around them by walking, cycling or taking vehicles with various purposes and such movements in the cities generate “organic” boundaries.

A couple of random ideas:

- One interesting connection between physics and evolution I've come across is the ""fluctuation theorem"". This mathematical property of stochastic processes turns out to provide a common explanation to the second law of thermodynamics (increase of entropy) and Darwinian evolution (increase of fitness). I've blogged about this on John Baez's ""Azimuth"" [1]. I'd love to know how you react to this surprising connection, and what outlook you see.

Urban Scaling and Economic Analysis of Materials Stocked in Japanese Cities,"This research aims to explore the complexity inherent in the physical mass of cities—specifically in the materials that are stored within buildings and infrastructure. There is an important link between stocked materials and urban sustainability, particularly related to better understanding the resource requirements for the maintenance and growth of cities. This research explores materials stocked in Japanese cities, using a database with detailed GIS data of materials stored in buildings and roads at a resolution of one square kilometer. The analysis focuses on a single year, 2009 for buildings and 2010 for roads, and it includes two primary investigations: 1) urban scaling analyses to explore relationships between mass stocked, urban population, and other variables; and 2) non-parametric kernel estimations to better understand influential factors contributing to per-capita mass values. Results show a linear scaling relationship between mass stocked in buildings and urban area population, as well as a sublinear scaling relationships between mass stocked in roads, urban area population, and land area.

He has worked with and credits as mentors, Dean Bryant Vollendorf Proffesor Emeritus, UNCC and George Hascup AAP Cornel University. John is primarily interested is in the rationalization of city planning and the emerging field of the science of cities, the goal being to apply theory and methods from complex systems science to the research, analysis and design of urban environments. Cities are simultaneously the physical manifestation of buildings and infrastructure or hardware as well as the software and wetware of socio-economic systems and biological-ecological systems. Fractal cartography, cellular automata simulation, genetic algorithms and statistical physics are some of the theoretical components underlying a scientific framework of cities, utilizing technology and information. The science of cities incorporates a variety of frameworks—what Herbert Simon calls the ‘science of the artificial’—such as artificial life, agent based design, systems dynamics, information theory and data mining. With over half the world’s population living in cities and millions more moving to them every year, an understanding of growth and decay patterns in cities as organism-like systems within a broader context is intimately connected with meta-level processes such as global warming and developing long term sustainable and regenerative approaches to design.

In 1996 I graduated from a Master Class in Comparative Philosophy.

I have approximately 25 years of experience in ICT, management consulting and research.

In 2001, I started my own company ITINERA Management Services & Consulting focusing on:

    project portfolio and program management
    complexity and systems thinking
    knowledge and networks
    science & philosophy
    personal process reengineering

As management consultant, I partner with Quint Wellington Redwood, a leading IT management consulting company.

In 2009, I became chairman of the think thank of the Royal Society of Flemish Engineers . In this function, I am starting a five year, Brussels based, program to foster 'smart leadership' in business, politics and academia, through the dissemination of complexity based decision taking processes. A first milestone has been the Brussels conference ""Complexity: Friend or Foe?"". in December 2009, at which Geoffrey West from Santa Fe was the keynote speaker. More info and some Youtube video clips can be found here.

Right now I am preparing the launch of a new company that will steer, manage and execute the ""complexity program"" in the coming years. Initial projects will study complex phenomena such as obesity in Asia, adoption of smart textiles, strategy formulation and business performance in industrial organizations. Additionally we will launch a series of complexity and systems thinking based education programs for decision takers and managers, and we will work together with Belgian education institutes to disseminate insights from complexity science to students. Furthermore we aim to set-up a virtual platform to bring complexity specialists into contact with owners of complex problems, in order to develop relevant solution scenario's. Finally we want to measure ""complexity adoption"" of leaders and decision takers in Belgium and Europe.

I'd say the common theme in my research projects is ""relativity""—the realization that something is actually much more observer-dependent that I had imagined. I find this idea enormously beautiful, and tend to look for it everywhere. Did you know that your red T-shirt will be blue to me if I run (very fast) into your arms?

A couple of random ideas:

- One interesting connection between physics and evolution I've come across is the ""fluctuation theorem"". This mathematical property of stochastic processes turns out to provide a common explanation to the second law of thermodynamics (increase of entropy) and Darwinian evolution (increase of fitness). I've blogged about this on John Baez's ""Azimuth"" [1]. I'd love to know how you react to this surprising connection, and what outlook you see.

- The result which really got me excited about complex systems is West's and Bettencourt's ""scaling law of cities"" [2]. As far as I can tell, it's really the first ""law of cities"".

Robustness of interbank lending networks,,Economics,Business and administration,6,Molly King,Sociology,Social and behavioural science,"I am a sociology PhD student at Stanford. I'm broadly interested in organizations, inequality, complexity, networks, science, knowledge, health, and bioethics.

Broadly, I am interested in information inequality in social systems. I am interested in investigating why people ask the questions they do and the social consequences of asking (or not asking) those questions. I hope to begin to understand the dynamics of information inequality in social networks: Which paths are critical to the flows of information? How can I use natural properties of networks to explain and predict social transmission of key informational resources? Particularly, I hope to investigate organizational membership overlaps as sites where people may learn to ask key questions that get them access to particular resources. I hope to incorporate multiplex networks to model these social overlaps.

Methodologically, I believe that a network approach to viewing the world has much to reveal about social reality. I am interested in applying network analysis not only to the relationships among people, but also to relations among ideas and social structures. For instance, I'm currently working on a little project network analysis on a dataset of departments and programs in universities over the past 30 years, I am developing an empirical measure of intellectual distance between academic fields.

I've also been kicking around the (very vague) idea of creating a genetic-regulation-style model of change and reproduction in social organizations/institutions. Would love to talk with anyone interested in applying genetic algorithms or genetic theory to larger units of analysis.

I received my BA in Biology from Reed College in Portland, Oregon, where I wrote my thesis on genetics and gene regulatory proteins. I then worked for a few years as a research assistant in medical informatics. Our research focused on clinical team structures and information technologies that support higher quality, lower cost health care for patients with chronic conditions. I'm broadly interested in health system reform, questions of distributive justice in health care, and understanding organizational change and technology implementation.

I completed my undergraduate studies in Biology at Reed College in Portland, Oregon.

Systems failure in corporate networks,"Corporations are the quintessential complex systems. As such, disruptions in their structure, dynamics or processes may lead to malfunction which ultimately result in their failure. Accordingly, a systematic study aiming at characterizing the patterns of anomalies that reflect problematic operations could potentially help in the early detection and recovery from a tragic collapse. Unfortunately, it is virtually impossible to obtain publicly available data that allow a comprehensive study of such entities. In this work, we study a dataset containing the e-mail folders of 150 employees of the former Enron Corporation, which was made publicly available as a result of the investigation of the ""Enron scandal"".

If physiological symptoms such as increased temperature or heart rate result from altered network structure, function, and dynamics (or vice versa), there is therapeutic potential in manipulation of these networks. Interactions of cellular, genetic, and metabolic networks with observable physiology may be hierarchical and should cross multiple scales.

Simple Agent-Based Model of the Development of Trust in Hierarchical Organizations,"Hierarchical organizations typically rely on a chain of command in which supervisors instruct subordinates to perform certain actions in order to advance the interests and objectives of the organization. The trust between supervisors and subordinates is essential for the functioning of such hierarchical organizations, as it ensures the eventual execution of instructions. Despite this, blind trust and obedience may lead to the execution of instructions with negative consequences, which may have been avoided had a subordinate been more critical of a supervisor’s instructions. We thus aim to model the development of trust between subordinates, their supervisors and the structures of the organization itself, subject to the understanding of the consequences of instructions by subordinates and the eventual outcomes of executed instructions. This is achieved through the construction of an agent-based model that is capable of replicating a number of intuitive behaviors and the use of this model to provide an indication of how trust develops over time.",,Business and administration,7,Donovan Platt,Mathematics,Mathematics and statistics,"I am currently working towards an MSc in the field of Computational and Applied Mathematics at the University of the Witwatersrand, as part of the QuERI Lab research group.

The Effects of Network Structure and Dynamics in Complex Systems,,Networks,Computing,6,Carver Tate,"Communication, Culture, Technology",Journalism and information,"Hello, my name is Carver and I am from New York City. I am currently a graduate student at Georgetown University in the Communication, Culture, and Technology Program. I have not chosen a specific topic for my thesis yet, but my interests include the effects of technology on society (both past and present), the problem of information overload in society and how we might create new ways of processing information to make it more manageable, and developing a more interconnected approach to globalization studies that reflects how each element of globalization effects the other. I see complexity theory relating to each of these interests in different ways. With respect to the effects of technology on society, technological innovation and diffusion has followed the traditional S shaped curve and has been shown to mimic the Kondratiev wave. If these patterns are studied more in-depthly it might be possible to make more accurate projections about whether the rate of technological growth and innovation will remain the same or increase in the future. In terms of information overload, I think complexity theory can offer news ways of classifying how ""complex"" a given piece of information is and offer the simplest way of navigating it. Visual simulations of complex information can also offer a new and more easily digestible format, the same way a traditional x-y graph makes it easier to see the behavior and draw conclusions about a function. Finally, up until this point globalization studies have focused on specific parts of globalization such as economics or culture, but there has yet to be an approach that tries to see how all aspects of globalization are connected and effect one another. I think complexity theory offers the best method for trying to synthesize these different areas and creating a more holistic approach, viewing globalization as more of a complex adaptive system. I do not come from a math or computer science background, so my knowledge of each area is very limited. I have been brushing up on calculus and differential equations for the past month and hope that I have learned enough to at least be able to speak the language, but any help from my fellow summer programmers would be greatly appreciated.

My project basically is about theoretical Systems Biology of aging. Aging is a tough problem since nobody know how it works and what it is. We approach theoretical description of aging through an investigation of metabolic and regulatory networks resilience and robustness.

Currently I investigate local stability of dynamics of chemical species concentration in metabolic networks based on different graph typologies. In future I plan to study dynamical properties of metabolic networks using bifurcation analysis.

One more interesting direction in my project is to connect thermodynamics of metabolic networks with dynamics, e. g. to investigate how the changes in the entropy production function correlates with different dynamical states in metabolic networks.

I also want to investigate topological robustness of graphs in the later stage of my project.",Ukrainian,Male,Student,Groningen University,Netherlands,51-100,2012,Santa Fe,Kyle,

income improvements. Although I worked for a few years in heath systems 
performance, I come from an economics background. In a previous life 
(during undergrad) I spent a summer at SFI working on a stock market 
computer simulation with Doyne Farmer. For dissertation research, I am 
pursuing a project to quantify how health insurance changes savings 
behavior and the impact of health shocks on a household’s probability of
 falling into poverty.
At CSSS, I’m hoping to gain greater insight into agent-based 
simulation and evolutionary game theory. I am also looking forward to 
collaborations with other students and the project component of the 
school. 
I’d be happy to discuss economic development literature and 
models and its connection to public health as well as teach 
microeconomics courses. 
One reason I wanted to come to Santa Fe was because I think the 
economic development process (especially the way in which income and 
health mutually reinforce each other) occurs in a nonlinear way. Any 
project that focused this health-wealth link would be interesting to me.
 One specific idea would be to model the impact of infectious disease 
spread, changes to income, and a person’s ability to avoid future 
ill-health. The model could investigate whether and how these dynamics 
produce poverty traps.

simple random walk dynamics. Inspired by the well-known relation between
 number of steps and mean squared distance in pure diffusive process, we
 studied diffusion over complex networks, using several models of

rate at which the process reaches larger distances is also of interest, 
we additionally studied the spreading rate, which is simply a measure of
 the random walker efficiency to spread away from the node that started

Evolutionary dynamics of fitness driven walkers on a graph,"The availability of empirical data on {humans and animal mobility has 
had a crucial impact on many dynamical processes found in both nature 
and society}. Here we take a closer look at the influences of both 
mobility and non-trivial network architecture on how interactions among 
individuals progress. Conventional models that involve spatial games are
 limited to representing players as nodes in the network with 
interactions steered by the linkages to other nodes, apart from the game
 rules. In this work, instead of using nodes to represent individual 
agents, we use the nodes to represent communities where players are 
situated. Two general processes are involved in this study namely,  the 
inter-node and intra-node dynamics, where each is described by its own 
spatio-temporal scale. Inside the nodes, individual players evolve under
 the context of the Ultimatum Game. This paradigm provides a measure, 
which is the average fitness of individuals inside a node, that can be 
interpreted as a mechanistic drive behind the mobility of agents on a 
network.

Network's shortest paths,"Consider a random network consisting of N nodes where each pair of nodes is connected with a given probability p (see Erdos-Renyi random graph).
 The question is about the shortest path through the network from one 
node to another (also called geodesic path, or intervertex distance):
Can we calculate analytically (and exactly) the probability 
distribution of shortest paths in such a network? That is, how likely it
 is that a pair of nodes chosen at random will be distance D apart. For distance D=1 the answer is obviously p. What are such probabilities for distances D=2, D=3, D=4, etc.?
Note that the network has a finite number of nodes (which is not necessarily large) and there are only 2 parameters here, N and p.
This is a simple yet fundamental question and there is much more to 
follow in terms of immediate applications and new theories once we 
answer it.

Revolutionary Fervor as Contagion: A Network Model of Rebellion,"In this project, we model revolutionary activism on networks.  
Revolutionary fervor spreads through the network like a contagion, but 
depends on the revolutionary thresholds and grievance levels of each 
node.  We provide for nodal removal and rewiring to better capture the 
underlying dynamics that drive revolutions and endogenize regime 
legitimacy.   Our model deviates from existing work insofar as we 
arrange actors along a continuum, allowing for counter-revolutionaries 
and police to eventually be coopted into the revolution.  This is a 
crucial condition for successful revolutions, which is too often 
gainsaid.  Ultimately, we find that initial network structure has a 
negligible effect on long-run dynamics and that under many parameter

Specifically, we aim to search the space of CAs to identify minimal computational units, which may in turn be used to execute specific computational tasks or optimize further search for collective computational behavior. In order to select for CAs with more computational capacity, we use an objective function defined in terms of dual total correlation (DTC), an information-theoretic quantity capturing the information in higher-order correlations between cells in a given spatial (and temporal) region of the time-dependent CA grid.

Of special interest are Levy walk models and anomalous diffusion, both in terms of data and in terms of evolutionary analysis of optimal foraging. My research has always been at the interface between theory and empirical work, based on movement models of animals and data to test those models.

Percolation in Google,,Computing Science,Computing,3,Jacopo Tagliabue,Philosophy,Humanities,"Hi all,


 
This is “my profile release 2.0”, including exciting updates such as a 
new profile picture and answers to Dan’s questions as they are posted in
 the homepage. 


I am student of philosophy at San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy. I 
am a jr. researcher in “Experimental and Applied Epistemology”  @ CRESA,  and a jr. researcher in “Life-Span Extension Methodologies” @ iLabs. I am currently figuring out what these strange tags actually mean. 


My B.A. dissertation was on foundational issues in ontology and I am 
still spending part of my life convincing myself that I do not exist. In
 my M.A. dissertation I’d like to shed some new light on the concept of 
“complexity” borrowing tools from formal ontology and philosophical 
logic. I strongly feel that a qualitative theory of information is 
needed to make sense of how complexity emerges from low-level 
simplicity, but unfortunately I now have just some vague clues of how 
such a theory may look like. I hope CSSS will help me figuring out if 
all this work makes more sense than the previous one. 


'simplex sigillum veri' has always been my favorite motto since my first
 B.A. year, but I think I’ll switch to 'complex sigillum veri' before 
CSSS.

Space of complex networks and robustness,,Network Analysis,Computing,4,Marco Antonio Duenas Esterling,Economics,Social and behavioural science,"I'm a 4th year PhD student in Economics at Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies in Pisa-Italy. My research is related to Trade Networks and Economic Growth. I have a degree in physics, I worked on quantum gates using cold atoms, that was a fantastic theoretical work. Then something happened and I decided to do a MA in Economics, the thesis was related to spatial prisoners dilemma.

To give you an idea about my PhD thesis I investigate whether the gravity model employed in international trade theory can explain the statistical properties of the International Trade Network. The idea is to estimate with econometrics methods the trade flows among countries, or the weights of the links, and then see if these estimations are equivalent to what it is observed in the real network. It can sound strange a ""gravity model in economics"", but the idea actually works quite nice, the term ""gravity"" comes about because the predicted relation between trade flows and explanatory variables is similar to Newton's formula: the magnitude of aggregated trade flows between a pair of countries is proportional to the product of country sizes (e.g. the masses, as proxied by country GDPs) and inversely proportional to their geographic distance (interpreted as proxies of trade-resistance factors, e.g. tariffs).

Look that this notion of gravity in social sciences can be adapted to many systems, e.g. migrations, describe how consumers flow between different shopping malls, patients between hospitals... I would be very happy to help interested people in econometric techniques related with the gravity like model, it is connected to Poisson models in count data analysis and Logistic regressions... So if you have the data we could start now to think a project.

One of the conclusions of my research is that the gravity model in trade successfully replicates some weighted-network structure of the trade network, but only if one fixes its binary architecture equal to the observed one. Conversely, the gravity approach performs very badly when asked to predict the presence of a link, or the level of the trade flow it carries, whenever the binary structure must be simultaneously estimated. Hence, one topic I'm very interested is in network formation.

On the side of economic growth I did an empirical analysis of cross sectional GDP business cycles. Business cycles are obtained after applying filtering techniques to country time series, and the cycle is sometimes used in economic literature as white noise that characterize economic fluctuations and volatility. The probability density functions of those cycles show fat-tails, and the volatilities are characterized by an inverse power law relation with the country size. The conclusion is that heterogeneity in economic systems survives to many frequency levels, in other words independently of the filter you can apply there is something that remains, so is the cycle white noise?",Italian,Male,Student,Sant'Anna School for Advanced Studies,Italy,Unlisted,2012,Santa Fe,Kyle,

My academic interests are in dynamical networks, particularly 
ones that resemble our brains in some abstract way. I studied 
neuroscience at MIT as an undergrad, motivated by the prospects of 
replicating intelligence in machines and understanding a bit better this
 very machine that is currently constructing this silly self-referential

Here's a few beliefs I have;

We have a lot to learn from nature, and biology in specific. 
It's had several billion years to get its act together and its latest 
presentation is quite impressive.Brains are only one example of a wide class of complex networks 
which can compute things or otherwise act ""intelligently"".  Nature found
 one path, but it doesn't mean there aren't a whole host of other ones. 
What's common between various classes of these networks?By studying the neurophisiologicafunctional basis of animal 
intelligence, I think humans can hope to help humanity in at least a 
couple of ways:
Contributing to our own self knowledge.  There are some pretty 
simple lessons that have had deep impacts on my life when looked at 
through certain glasses. Let me give you an example. Donald Hebb
 one of the first greats in theoretical neuroscience proposed that 
""neurons that fire together wire together."" Over the last 60 years this 
has been repeatedly verified empirically. If you think about it, what it
 means is that whatever perceptions or behaviors you are partaking in at
 the same time will later become more likely to occur simultaneously. 
This is enormously powerful once we understand it.  It means we can work
 to break ourselves of old habits and form new patterns of behavior that
 serve our lives.Building machines that do menial or repetitive tasks for us.  Face 
it, you want a robot to drive you around. Or to go find you a bunch of 
cool new music that you probably will like.
I've enjoyed reading about the specifics of people's academic work on
 here, so why don't I just plagiarize myself briefly and copy over a 
paragraph from my CSSS application which summarizes my academic self as 
well as anything:


I want to understand intelligent perception and behavior by building,
 analyzing and finding patterns in and characteristics of complex 
dynamical networks. The central question I am interested in addressing 
is: given a mathematical description for internal as well as intra-node 
dynamics, how do patterns in the structural topology of a dynamical 
network predictably give rise to patterns in its functional behavior. Or
 more compactly: how does structure map to function of a network?

 is a recent project I completed on studying the ways in which networks 
of spiking neurons can generate interesting patterns. It probably raised
 more questions for me than I answered, but perhaps thats a good thing?

Evolutionary dynamics of fitness driven walkers on a graph,"The availability of empirical data on {humans and animal mobility has 
had a crucial impact on many dynamical processes found in both nature 
and society}. Here we take a closer look at the influences of both 
mobility and non-trivial network architecture on how interactions among 
individuals progress. Conventional models that involve spatial games are
 limited to representing players as nodes in the network with 
interactions steered by the linkages to other nodes, apart from the game
 rules. In this work, instead of using nodes to represent individual 
agents, we use the nodes to represent communities where players are 
situated. Two general processes are involved in this study namely,  the 
inter-node and intra-node dynamics, where each is described by its own 
spatio-temporal scale. Inside the nodes, individual players evolve under
 the context of the Ultimatum Game. This paradigm provides a measure, 
which is the average fitness of individuals inside a node, that can be 
interpreted as a mechanistic drive behind the mobility of agents on a 
network.

Network's shortest paths,"Consider a random network consisting of N nodes where each pair of nodes is connected with a given probability p (see Erdos-Renyi random graph).
 The question is about the shortest path through the network from one 
node to another (also called geodesic path, or intervertex distance):
Can we calculate analytically (and exactly) the probability 
distribution of shortest paths in such a network? That is, how likely it
 is that a pair of nodes chosen at random will be distance D apart. For distance D=1 the answer is obviously p. What are such probabilities for distances D=2, D=3, D=4, etc.?
Note that the network has a finite number of nodes (which is not necessarily large) and there are only 2 parameters here, N and p.
This is a simple yet fundamental question and there is much more to 
follow in terms of immediate applications and new theories once we 
answer it.

Diffusion at the Boundary: Measures to Characterize the Diffusion Process in Complex Networks,"Many propagation processes on networks can be explained by assuming a 
simple random walk dynamics. Inspired by the well-known relation between
 number of steps and mean squared distance in pure diffusive process, we
 studied diffusion over complex networks, using several models of 
networks: random, small-world, scale-free and geographical. Because the 
rate at which the process reaches larger distances is also of interest, 
we additionally studied the spreading rate, which is simply a measure of
 the random walker efficiency to spread away from the node that started 
the process. Our results thus far show that many important features of 
the network topology are displayed by these measures. The results to 
come involve the scaling of these measures with network size and 
density.

Note that the network has a finite number of nodes (which is not necessarily large) and there are only 2 parameters here, N and p.
This is a simple yet fundamental question and there is much more to 
follow in terms of immediate applications and new theories once we 
answer it.

Exploring healing strategies on Random Boolean Networks,,Biology?,Computing,5,Amitabh Trehan,Computer Science,Computing,"I am working towards a PhD in Computer Science at the University of New Mexico.

My current research is towards developing self-healing algorithms for reconfigurable networks. Reconfigurable networks are networks in which we can add links when needed such as peer-to-peer networks. My advisor Prof. Saia Jared Saia and I are attempting to develop algorithms for efficient reconnections (in terms of some invariants and resource costs) in such networks under attack. We are looking for (and finding) interesting connections in other areas such as electrical circuits and many biological/ecological systems.

Recently, I have also been interested in populations dynamics modelling using coupled differential equations, a project from a NonLinear Dynamics course I took this semester.

I hope to extend these projects during the summer school with the help of enthusiastic experts :)

Otherwise, I am interested in learning about almost everyting around (unless the maths is too complicated!) me and also things in outer space (cosmology). I have an undergraduate degree in Biology. I dabbled a bit in phonetics (and multilingual typesetting (LaTeX), computer codes) too, which formed the subject for my M.Tech. thesis.

Align with my broad research area, I am interested in machine learning, data mining, dynamical system theory, artificial intelligence, computational learning theory, physics of disordered systems, complex networks and related fields.

Currently, my focus is on reservoir computing, which is a new paradigm in neural networks and has shown great performance in non-linear and chaotic signal processing. In contrast to traditional neural networks, in which the system is fine tuned using a learning algorithm to solve a particular task, in reservoir computing a recurrent neural network is initialized and fixed with no further fine tuning. The signal is given to the network and a linear readout layer performs a linear combination of the states to produce the target output. The weights of the linear combination is calculated using linear regression which can be performed in closed form efficiently. My goal is to understand this paradigm better and study what kinds of problems they can and they cannot solve and how the paradigm can be applied to unconventional computing substrates such as nanoscale self-assembled electronics or DNA molecules.

My most recent work on reservoir computing is the direct estimation of error in task solving based on the structure of the dynamical system and statics of the input and output.

Mapping Complexity/Human Knowledge as a Complex Adaptive System,,,Computing,2,Anna Zaytseva,Information Systems,Computing,"I am doing my PhD in Information Systems at the University of Oslo in Norway (3rd year), and soon I am going to get my degree. I apply the approach of Complex Adaptive Systems to generate a stepwise method to study mutual shaping between technologies and law, so the space in between those two – at the edge – is in focus. That space is a CAS with memory. I have two case studies of radically different e-health technologies of Norway, and each case has an own CAS. A CAS initially consists of about a hundred to almost a thousand smallest elements depending on the scale of a case. The elements are legal as norms & values, technologic as technical & conceptual, and social in situ & ex situ for the design work. Having appeared once, the elements of each CAS re-appear in time and increase in quantity to several thousand, what makes the memories be path-dependent and highly interconnected inside. Although the research is completely qualitative, manual and bottom-up, it provides a non-linear analysis of the phenomenon of mutual shaping between technologies and law with large visual representations at each subsequent step conducted in accordance with rules, which I have generated from one case study and replicated in another. In my method, I trace causalities in the CAS(s) and test a hypothesis whether attractors in the legal environment are shared among the design works on those technologies. Three attractors from four vs. six are shared, whereas the remaining ones invite a third case study. Unique technical implications in specific shapes and their information loops with the legal environment are indicated and the reasons explained. The research provides a transdisciplinary path for studying the complexity between law and technologies and calls specialists in the local fields – law, design studies and organization science – to examine the findings in detail by use of their own discipline methodologies.

My own initial background is in law, which I got at the National Research University – Higher School of Economics in Russia, and I wrote my Master’s thesis on policy analysis of standardization in six innovation markets of the European Union, what I did at Linköping University in Sweden. Besides, I have work experience both in public and private organizations. I am very interested in technologies and their architectures, as well as approaches to anticipate future. I have my own home library in Complexity Science that I consider to be advanced transdisciplinary methodology in harmony with nature. Therefore, at CSSS 2015 I am particularly interested to learn more about emerging transdisciplinary approaches for data analysis, where meanings behind words play crucial role. I am also concerned about visualization issues, co-evolution phenomena, bottom-up analytic strategies for complex systems research, information theory aspects, and simplicity behind the variety of self-organization forms. I vote for proper respect of sciences to each other, their synthesis and tight international collaboration, what I want to work for.

Currently working on the architecture-based algorithm decomposition approach, which uses patterns and certain characteristics of a computational kernel to map the kernel onto the most suitable processing device in a hybrid architecture. Also working on developing mathematical foundations for patterns in parallel programming.

Use cases are based on real-world problems in Computational Biology and Geophysics. These use cases have been acquired during collaborative simulation development projects with the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology and the GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences.

Diffusion at the Boundary: Measures to Characterize the Diffusion Process in Complex Networks,"Many propagation processes on networks can be explained by assuming a 
simple random walk dynamics. Inspired by the well-known relation between
 number of steps and mean squared distance in pure diffusive process, we
 studied diffusion over complex networks, using several models of 
networks: random, small-world, scale-free and geographical. Because the 
rate at which the process reaches larger distances is also of interest, 
we additionally studied the spreading rate, which is simply a measure of
 the random walker efficiency to spread away from the node that started 
the process. Our results thus far show that many important features of 
the network topology are displayed by these measures. The results to 
come involve the scaling of these measures with network size and 
density.

"It from Bit: cellular automata, driven ising model, and emergent computation","We explored emergent computation within two systems — cellular automata (CA) and a driven Ising model. We attempted to generate emergent computation with a CA using a genetic algorithm, with the aim of understanding general conditions on information processing dynamics which increase computational capacity. Specifically, we aim to search the space of CAs to identify minimal computational units, which may in turn be used to execute specific computational tasks or optimize further search for collective computational behavior. In order to select for CAs with more computational capacity, we use an objective function defined in terms of dual total correlation (DTC), an information-theoretic quantity capturing the information in higher-order correlations between cells in a given spatial (and temporal) region of the time-dependent CA grid. The genetic algorithm evolves a population of CA update rules by testing average performance over a range of initial conditions, creating a new population favoring more successful rules, and iterating over a number of generations.",,Computing,5,Kyle Reing,Computer Science,Computing,"I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at USC with roughly 2 years under my belt.

Evolutionary dynamics of fitness driven walkers on a graph,"The availability of empirical data on {humans and animal mobility has

mobility and non-trivial network architecture on how interactions among

 limited to representing players as nodes in the network with 
interactions steered by the linkages to other nodes, apart from the game
 rules. In this work, instead of using nodes to represent individual 
agents, we use the nodes to represent communities where players are 
situated. Two general processes are involved in this study namely,  the 
inter-node and intra-node dynamics, where each is described by its own 
spatio-temporal scale. Inside the nodes, individual players evolve under
 the context of the Ultimatum Game. This paradigm provides a measure, 
which is the average fitness of individuals inside a node, that can be 
interpreted as a mechanistic drive behind the mobility of agents on a

My broad research area is computer systems and networking. I'm currently studying communication in autonomous wireless networks and trying to address the problem of energy-efficient coordination of access to the shared wireless channel in a multihop wireless environment, such as ad hoc and sensor networks. I especially enjoy working on problems where I can do practical system implementation and experimentation work and look at the system behavior analytically, as well.

I applied to attend the summer school because I think it may be interesting to think about the problem of coordinating channel access in a complex systems context. In a multihop wireless network, contention and interference effects generally extend further than the data communication range. As a result, senders have to decide when to transmit, despite having incomplete knowledge of both conflicting transmissions and the impact of their transmissions on the network.

So one of my goals this summer is to learn about complex systems techniques to see whether there is some interesting way to model the problem of coordinating channel access. But I'm also excited to learn from and collaborate with people working on all sorts of interesting problems...

statistical physics and non-linear dynamics,linguistics and network 
analyses. I am also interested in the history of science as complex 
system. Some time in the future I would love to take a closer look at 
cell signaling, neuroscience, cognitive science and biophysics. I enjoy 
reading urtexts from the era when science was called natural philosophy 
and when the earlier attempt of the complexity approach still reined. 
I decided to embark on scientific career at the age of 12 by 
joining an astronomy club in my hometown, which led me eventually to 
studying theoretical physics with specialization in astrophysics and to 
working in one of the biggest in Europe (and I believe the best :)) 
astrophysical observatories. For my past participation in astronomical 
expeditions to some hard-accessible regions of the world I was accepted 
this year into the New York chapter of the Explorers club  ""http://www.explorers.org/"".
My experience in the Observatory included both collecting data, 
by making observations on the 2.6 m diameter optical telescope (with 
especially unforgettable long cold winter nights when sky is especially 
clear), and analysing the data via building quantitative models of 
stellar atmospheres and computer experiments. Multi-skilled requirements
 for a scientist and interdisciplinary approach were essential for the 
Observatory's reseach culture, triggering my interest in complex 
systems.
I also developed interest in linguistics and learned English, 
Italian and Greek in addition to my native Russian, thus taking samples 
out of four different language groups of the Indo-European family. 
Currently, I am planning to add Sanskrit to my collection and I am very 
interested in the quantitative approach to the problem of 
proto-languages. I also have a long-standing interest in comparative 
mythology, which probably every astrophysicist necessarily develops via 
wondering about the origin of constellations. Some time in the future I 
would love to take a closer look at the paleoclimatology and at the 
links uniting all these seemingly different fields of study.
After realizing the extend of the power of economic forces over 
the life of societies and over the life of scientific networks and how, 
in fact, little understood and developed this branch of science is, I 
went to New York to study quantitative finance, got some financial 
markets experience and attended since autumn 2006 the New York 
Quantitative Finance seminar, thus getting the first-row-seat 
observation point at the financial crisis of 2008 and at the attempts to
 analyze it.
I would say that my biggest interest at this point is in the ways
 to develop new quantitative risk measures applicable to the global 
financial markets, perhaps by applying the methods of network analysis. 
In addition, I am interested in studies of sustainability of 
companies, cities and societies as complex adaptive systems, in studies 
of information flow in complex networks and in the studies of how the 
dynamics of the knowledge diffusion affects technologies and innovation.
 I'm interested in the quantitative studies of what causes instability 
and collapses of the financial markets and societies as complex 
networks. Perhaps it's good time to apply what we have learned from hard
 sciences to find a sound way towards stability and optimization, which 
would in turn allow us to concentrate on our Das Glasperlenspiel. At 
least, that's the idea.
Im my free time I enjoy hiking and running.

"The Robustness, Stability and Persistence of Niche-Structured Food Webs",,Network Analysis,Computing;Life sciences,4,Miguel Lurgi,Computer Science,Computing,"My main research interests are focused on: (i) the understanding of the mechanisms behind the emergence of structure in ecological networks of different kinds, primarily food webs, plant-pollinator and host-symbiont networks; (ii) the study of the assembly and disassembly dynamics of ecological networks, particularly how relevant is evolution and the emergence of novelty for these processes; and (iii) the stability of this kind of networks, how to measure it and how this stability is related to the network structure and dynamics. All this in the context of environmental change and how different components of this change (e.g. climate change, habitat loss, species invasions) affect the structure of the interactions network and ultimately the dynamics of the system and the species populations, and the ecosystem functioning.

From a theoretical perspective I tackle these problems through an individual (agent) based, spatially explicit simulation approach. Because evolutionary change occurs at the level of the individual, this scale is relevant for the kind of problems mentioned above; also, interactions in real ecosystem ultimately happen at the individual level and the spatial scale is important when looking at the actual occurrence of these interactions.

I have also applied complex networks techniques for the analysis of empirically obtained interaction networks to look at the changes of their structure due to climate change.

Expertise
As a computer scientist I have worked mainly in the development of multi-agent based systems and have also some experience in other computational techniques such as genetic algorithms and neural networks.

Trade network formation: the role of technology and geography,,"Network Analysis, Economics",Computing;Social and behavioural science,2,Marco Antonio Duenas Esterling,Economics,Social and behavioural science,"I'm a 4th year PhD student in Economics at Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies in Pisa-Italy. My research is related to Trade Networks and Economic Growth. I have a degree in physics, I worked on quantum gates using cold atoms, that was a fantastic theoretical work. Then something happened and I decided to do a MA in Economics, the thesis was related to spatial prisoners dilemma.

To give you an idea about my PhD thesis I investigate whether the gravity model employed in international trade theory can explain the statistical properties of the International Trade Network. The idea is to estimate with econometrics methods the trade flows among countries, or the weights of the links, and then see if these estimations are equivalent to what it is observed in the real network. It can sound strange a ""gravity model in economics"", but the idea actually works quite nice, the term ""gravity"" comes about because the predicted relation between trade flows and explanatory variables is similar to Newton's formula: the magnitude of aggregated trade flows between a pair of countries is proportional to the product of country sizes (e.g. the masses, as proxied by country GDPs) and inversely proportional to their geographic distance (interpreted as proxies of trade-resistance factors, e.g. tariffs).

Look that this notion of gravity in social sciences can be adapted to many systems, e.g. migrations, describe how consumers flow between different shopping malls, patients between hospitals... I would be very happy to help interested people in econometric techniques related with the gravity like model, it is connected to Poisson models in count data analysis and Logistic regressions... So if you have the data we could start now to think a project.

One of the conclusions of my research is that the gravity model in trade successfully replicates some weighted-network structure of the trade network, but only if one fixes its binary architecture equal to the observed one. Conversely, the gravity approach performs very badly when asked to predict the presence of a link, or the level of the trade flow it carries, whenever the binary structure must be simultaneously estimated. Hence, one topic I'm very interested is in network formation.

On the side of economic growth I did an empirical analysis of cross sectional GDP business cycles. Business cycles are obtained after applying filtering techniques to country time series, and the cycle is sometimes used in economic literature as white noise that characterize economic fluctuations and volatility. The probability density functions of those cycles show fat-tails, and the volatilities are characterized by an inverse power law relation with the country size. The conclusion is that heterogeneity in economic systems survives to many frequency levels, in other words independently of the filter you can apply there is something that remains, so is the cycle white noise?",Italian,Male,Student,Sant'Anna School for Advanced Studies,Italy,Unlisted,2012,Santa Fe,Kyle,

Complex Systems Techniques applied to Power Transmission Expansion Planning,"Choosing how new lines should be installed in a power grid, or Transmission Expansion Planning (TEP) is a problem of considerable complexity. Any power grid has a large number (hundreds to tens of thousands) of components, meaning that any upgrades must take into account the current infrastructure. Additionally, there are many possible additional lines that one could add to an existing power grid. Furthermore, any design must be weighted by investment and operation cost. This requires analyzing the optimal use of generation and transmission assets using optimal power flow models that simulate the physical laws governing power flows (Kirchhoff’s Laws) as well as infrastructure limits. Given the importance of this problem, many approaches have been tested.

The Electricity Grid as a case-study on the Interface of Engineering Systems and Human Behavior,,,Engineering and engineering trades,4,Alexis Dinno,Epidemiologist,Health,"Hello!
 
 My name is Alexis, but friends call me Lexy-Lou (or Lex, or&#133;), and I am a social epidemiologist and social ecologist. I have just defended my dissertation at Harvard School of Public Health where I majored in quantitative methods (emphasis on statistical modeling: multilevel models, spatial models, causal models, etc.) in the department of Health and Social Behavior (now Society, Health and Human Development). The third chapter of my dissertation entails a loop analysis of residential depressive experience, urban neighborhood property abandonment and urban greenspace programs.
 
 My interests in complex systems analysis are diverse:
 
  I have an abiding interest in the ontological and ideological commitments implicit in the choice of a specific analytic method. What kinds of inquiry are mobilized by systems analyses? How do they differ from (non-systems) alternatives?
 
  I have recently published an implementation of Richard Levins' qualitative loop analysis (Loop Analyst) for R on CRAN with some recent extensions. However, I am not a computer scientist, and the computationally intensive nature of the method demands that I produce more efficient code for the current implementation as well as for future extensions. Therefore I hope to sharpen my mathematical and computing skills.
 
  I have found qualitative loop analysis of system behavior to be a rewarding and robust analytic method. However, this has only been my introduction to systems approaches, and I would like both to extend my analytic repertoire, as well as to situate my ""toolkit"" within a wider domain of systems methods.

Local and nonlocal information in a traffic network: how important is the horizon?,"Recent advances in distributed sensor network technology have changed
 the landscape of traffic optimization in which small, mobile devices 
are able to sense local information and communicate in real time with 
one another.  Naive optimization algorithms that operate solely on the 
local or global level are inherently flawed, as global optimization 
requires every local sensor to communicate with a centralized 
base-station, creating prohibitive bandwidth, robustness, and security 
concerns, while local optimization methods are limited by a near 
information horizon as they are unable to propagate or react to 
information beyond their immediate vicinity.  This paper investigates an
 intermediate approach where individual sensors are able to propagate 
congestion information over a variable distance that is determined in 
real-time.  This strategy consistently out-performs a naive strategy 
where every car simply takes the shortest path to its destination, but 
does worse than a simpler optimization algorithm that only incorporates 
local information.  This is most likely because the intermediate 
solution directs cars along the same alternate path when attempting to 
free a congested area, thus creating new congestion along the detour. 
The results suggest that local information might set an upper bound on 
performance in models of cascading information.  Further work is 
required to confirm this observation and develop an algorithm able to 
join both local and global information to effectively diffuse traffic 
around congestion. 
",Engineering,Engineering and engineering trades,6,Giovanni Petri,"Engineering, Mathematics",Engineering and engineering trades;Mathematics and statistics,"Hello there, 
formalities first: I am Giovanni Petri, PhD student at the Centre for Transport Studies and the Complexity and Networks group at Imperial College London, my advisors being Prof. J. W. Polak on the engineering side and Prof. H. J. Jensen on the math one. 
You can drop me a Terry Pratchett quote at  gpetri@imperial.ac.uk or click here for the ugly site, or  here for my (slightly better) homepage;
 my  battle with wordpress  for graphic supremacy is ongoing: the site 
is in the making and soonish there might be something resembling a list 
of projects. 
Chit chat now: 
I've always been fascinated by shapes, pattern and regularities, 
belonging to math, the real world or even just ways of thinking. So I 
ended up studying physics to (try and) make sense of all that. I 
completed my MSc in Theoretical Physics with a  thesis about primordial 
structure formation during Inflation, basically the Universe's wrinkles.
 As I was going through it turned out that what thrilled me had a lot in
 common with many issues in complex systems, statistical mechanics and 
the such. 
Making a long story short, I am working on the interfacing of 
information and transportation networks. It looks a long way to go from 
cosmology but -in truth- it’s not. The goal of identifying and 
characterizing extremely non-trivial and involved spatio-temporal 
patterns in a changing space from simple rules can be applied to both 
fields equally well.
Consider, for instance, a model of a traffic network, where cars 
circulate, coupled to an information network, where information 
diffuses. The population on a node influences the        informational state of
 the corresponding node in the information layer. The latter modifies 
the rules by which the cars go around.
What is happening is that you have a bunch of particles changing the 
landscape they are moving in, while the landscape defines where they are
 going to move next. Beyond the technicalities, the picture is not very 
different from early universe particles moving around according to a 
metric, that they contribute to modify as they move.
And if you find some self-organization, then that becomes VERY exciting!
  
Going back to the mundane, I live of short, very strong 
obsessions and these over the years encompassed basketball, tennis, 
squash, football, guitar (still trying, still failing), reading (lots!),
 trekking, video games (Eve Online for the converts), parkour and 
Capoeira. 
The last one, having lasted for quite a while now, is the exception that
 confirms the rule. Also, since there are so many climbers I wouldn't 
mind getting a crash course. No, wait, bad phrasing...
With languages I am slightly better than the average Italian, 
meaning that I can communicate in English, snore in French, had some 
pretty unsettling ""lost in translation"" experiences in German and sing 
(badly) in (poor) Portuguese.  
Oh and in London I'm trying to pick up  British accent and 
self-deprecating humor.

Agent-based modeling of fluidic self-assembly,I am building a home-made agent-based physical simulator of fluidic self-assembly for micro/nanoelectronical devices.

The proposed framework may constitute the first step in the introduction of this new approach to this emerging and challenging electronic manufacturing technique.,"Engineering, Physics",Engineering and engineering trades,1,Massimo Mastrangeli,Engineering,Engineering and engineering trades,"Hey!
I am a 3rd year Italian PhD student at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, in Leuven, Belgium. 
I also belong to Leuven's Interuniversity MicroElectronic Center (IMEC).
My field of research is mesoscopic self-assembly. Specifically, I am 
developing new techniques to improve the packaging and assembly of 
microchip. This (rather dull) task starts to appear exciting once you 
introduce stochastic techniques and self-assembling processes to work it
 out. It seems weird, and even weirder when it works!
Anyway, this was only the n-th trail that lead me to the galaxy of complex systems. This might well be something one wants to report to a psycotherapist.
I started getting interested in complexity by the end of my 
high-school years. At that time, to show my embarassing modesty, I 
wanted to write an interdisciplinary thesis on complexity. Unluckily, 
the boundaries of my books where to narrow to contain my notes (I guess 
someone said this already a few centuries ago), so I decided to change 
topic - I switched to ""space and time"", not sure I simplified my task. 
Anyhow, since then I started pursuing a (mostly self-taught) 
educational path through self-organization, dynamical systems, pattern 
formation, critical phenomena, evolutionary computation, artificial 
intelligence. For my BS thesis, I looked into phase-looked loops, whose 
functionality is built on non-linear dynamics. For my MS thesis, I 
investigated (microelectromechanical) resonators, acquiring a taste for 
these fundamental and ubiquitous objects. Meanwhile, I was feeding on 
books by Kosko, Kauffman, Gell-Mann, Deutsch, Penrose, Barabasi, 
Strogatz, Axelrod and more. I can candidly confess I am still addicted. 
Abusing of crack might be much cheaper.
Finally, I lately realized I probably want (a subset of) this 
stuff to be the leading theme of my future career. So I thought CSSS 
might be the right place to start this private phase transition.
My other interests include playing and composing music, singing in polyphonic choirs, reading, running and write satire and short essays (Italian only, so far). 
Keep in touch by writing me.

Complex Systems Techniques applied to Power Transmission Expansion Planning,"Choosing how new lines should be installed in a power grid, or Transmission Expansion Planning (TEP) is a problem of considerable complexity.

The most vulnerable (critical) edges and nodes were evaluated with complex network theory.

base-station, creating prohibitive bandwidth, robustness, and security

information horizon as they are unable to propagate or react to

 intermediate approach where individual sensors are able to propagate 
congestion information over a variable distance that is determined in 
real-time.  This strategy consistently out-performs a naive strategy 
where every car simply takes the shortest path to its destination, but 
does worse than a simpler optimization algorithm that only incorporates 
local information.  This is most likely because the intermediate 
solution directs cars along the same alternate path when attempting to 
free a congested area, thus creating new congestion along the detour. 
The results suggest that local information might set an upper bound on 
performance in models of cascading information.  Further work is 
required to confirm this observation and develop an algorithm able to 
join both local and global information to effectively diffuse traffic

Seismic Analysis of Power Systems Performance,"Civil infrastructure systems, including power systems, water delivery systems and communication systems, etc. are the essential urban elements and are also highly vulnerable to natural and man-made disasters such as earthquakes and terrorist attacks. Power system is especially crucial to emergency response, recovery, and post-disaster reconstruction. Damaged power systems could result in severe socio-economic consequences. Using the data from the power utilities including 2706 buses and more than 3400 branches, we studied the system reliability and the performance of the power system under both a given scenario earthquake and a hypothetical terrorist attack. The seismic reliability of the substations (nodes) was evaluated under the impact of earthquake. Power flow (load flow) analysis was conducted on the hypothetical power network. The most vulnerable (critical) edges and nodes were evaluated with complex network theory. These results can be used to estimate cascading failure and direct and indirect economic loss induced by the damaged power system. The results could also be useful for local planning department and power industries to evaluate the most vulnerable nodes/edges of the power system and improve their seismic performance under economic constrains.",,Engineering and engineering trades,3,Chang Liang,,,"Is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering and research assistant in the Mid-America Earthquake (MAE) Center at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), USA.

process-oriented and applied research on natural hazards and risk. One 
special focus is on the spatial and temporal evolution of risk and I 
conducted studies on the variability of natural hazard processes as well
 as of values at risk.
I believe that one of the fundamental reasons for the lack of 
progress regarding natural hazard risk is the continuing separation of 
the research on natural processes and social processes without 
considering interaction between these systems. Therefore, an objective 
is to develop more balanced analyses of risks associated with the 
interaction of socio-economic and geophysical processes.
My current research places emphasis to develop a conceptual model

 In this context the implications of complexity theory are a promising

Testing Modeling Assumptions in the West Africa Ebola Outbreak,"The Ebola virus in West Africa has infected almost 30,000 and killed over 11,000 people. Recent models of Ebola Virus Disease
(EVD) have often made assumptions about how the disease spreads, such as uniform transmissibility and homogeneous
mixing within a population. In this paper, we test whether these assumptions are necessarily correct, and offer simple solutions
that may improve disease model accuracy. First, we use data and models of West African migration to show that EVD does
not homogeneously mix, but spreads in a much more predictable manner. Next, we estimate the initial growth rate of EVD
within country administrative divisions and find that it significantly decreases with population density. Finally, we test whether

The Targeting and Timing of Treatment Influences the Emergence of Influenza Resistance in Structured Population,,Epidemiology,Health,4,Oscar Patterson Lomba,Applied Mathematics,Mathematics and statistics,"The spectrum of my scientific interests is wide-- which makes me an expert at nothing. I find much pleasure in exploring and sharing ideas about subjects such as adaptive networks, evolutionary theory, diseases (transmissible or not), human evolution and behavior, among others. This summer school, I excitedly suspect, will be a wonderful environment to engage in fruitful discussions of this kind.

I am originally from Cuba, where I did my undergraduate studies in Physics. Still passionate about Physics in general, I decided to switch gears and look into Applied Mathematics. I am in the second year of my Ph.D. at Arizona State University.

Project Interests
My research is basically related to mathematical epidemiology. More specifically, I am currently interested in the interplay between the evolution of transmissible diseases and population's contact structures. That is, how disease traits, such as virulence, evolve in response to the topological properties of the social network, and how, in turn, the disease dynamics influences the adaptive behaviors of the agents/nodes in the network and hence its topology. This, in a sense, is a broad research question, thus it can be framed or contextualized in many ways; ways that I am more than happy to talk about, explore and expand during my time at this CSSS. Finding answers to questions of this kind could be relevant to major public health issues such as the evolution of microbial drug resistance, the emergence of new diseases and vaccine designs.

I am currently working on a joint PhD in Economics and JD (law 
degree) at George Mason University in Arlington, VA.  My areas of 
concentration in economics are public choice (an economic analysis of politics), the economics of religion (similar to the sociology of religion, but using the tools of economic analysis), and ‘law and economics’.
  After seeing many impoverished areas of the world, I have a particular
 interest in how all of these factors affect economic development in the
 developing world.  Within law, my areas of interest include 
intellectual property, technology law, and criminal law.  My current 
research involves investigating the impact of gender imbalance (more 
women than men in a population or vice-versa) and information 
availability on marriage markets.
Prior to coming to GMU to study economics and law, I was a 
controls and project engineer working in the power industry.  I have a 
degree in mechanical engineering from Virginia Tech and an MBA from the 
University of Florida.
Besides my work and studies, I love to travel.  I’ve made it to 
28 countries, 7 continents (including Antarctica), and 50 states so far.
  I enjoy kayaking (probably not too much of that in the desert), 
camping, reading, and road trips just about anywhere and everywhere.
I look forward to meeting everyone this summer.  In the meantime, you can e-mail me at hollar@mindspring.com.

Characterizing Atrial Fibrillation Dynamics using Multiplex Visibility Graphs,"We performed simulations of normal rhythm and fibrillatory dynamics using the mono-domain formulation of the Rogers and McCulloch model. Clinical data were recorded from 4 patients with atrial fibrillation before and after successful catheter ablation procedure using a multi-electrode basket catheter. From multivariate times series of simulated and clinical data, we constructed multiplex visibility graphs. We then compared the structural properties of multiplex visibility graphs between time series from healthy and fibrillatory rhythms. For both simulations and clinical data, the giant component of the multiplex visibility graph was higher in time series of normal rhythm compared to time series of fibrillatory rhythms. The structural efficiency of the multiplex graphs was higher in normal rhythm compared to fibrillatory rhythms. Multiplex visibility graphs provide novel insights in cardiac dynamics, paving the way for a more in-depth characterization of fibrillatory rhythms. In particular, normal sinus rhythm is associated with multiplex visibility graphs that have greater connectivity and structural efficiency compared to fibrillatory dynamics.

Behavioral footprints of depression from mobile-phone usage patterns,"Depression is increasingly prevalent in society. Alone, it a↵ects over 16.1 million American adults and is today the single most pervasive mental illness in the world. Many efforts trying to address this problem leverage technological advancements such as smartphones and smart tracking devices, to facilitate patient self-reporting for use in analyses that can aid medical experts. However, patients frequently ”drop out” or do not self-report, likely a behavior caused by their perpetual depression. This begs the invention of reporting mechanisms that do not rely on active participation from the patient. In this paper, we investigate the relationships between behavioral indicators, measured from smartphone activity, and depression in a large population of highly interconnected young adults. We find that depression correlates strongly with features that indicate social activity, communicational responsiveness and academic attendance. Using this insight we construct a simple classification model that predicts, from their set of behavioral indicators, whether an individual is more or less depressed than the population median. Our results have implications to the future of depression treatment. For example, using a classification model based on the features we highlight here, alerting systems could be built to help counteract the onset of depression in individuals.",,Health,6,Freya Casier,Economics,Social and behavioural science,"Economist with interest in gender, social gerontology and cooperative organization.",,Female,Researcher,The Danish National Centre for Social Research,Denmark,Not University,2017,Santa Fe,Jackie,
Modeling Therapeutic Intervention In Sepsis,,"Biology, Medicine",Health,2,Mauricio Rosas,Medicine,Health,"My main research interest is related to regulation of inflammation by autonomic nervous system. Specifically, my thesis work addresses the anatomical and molecular pathway by which electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve attenuates systemic inflammation in an animal model of sepsis.

Sepsis is a health issue because of its high incidence, mortality and economical cost. Despite several years of research and clinical trials testing promising drugs, sepsis is considered to be an intractable disease. In part, this is so because current experimental and therapeutic strategies designed to harness inflammation are based on our understanding of a system with linear dynamics. More recently, however, the process of sepsis has been formulated in terms of complexity theory. Bodily organization and function are conceived as an emergent property of a non-linear, non-equilibrium system organized as a scale-free network. Loss of homeostasis in sepsis is perceived as the progression from a stable behavioral pattern or attractor to another characterized by organ dysfunction as a consequence of reduced connectedness between the system’s elements.

be at the game on Mother's day when Dallas Braden threw a perfect game! I
 still can hardly believe it happened. :-) 
I love the outdoors and when I'm not at a ball game on the 
weekends, I usually am hiking in the nearby Sierra Nevada mountains.  
I'm looking forward to being in Santa Fe, I hear there are great hiking 
trails all around.  Immediately after the summer program ends I'm headed
 up to Denver to go backpacking with my older brother in the Rockies for
 a week.  It should be a great time.
I enjoy gardening and taking care of my yard, although i don't 
really know much about what I'm doing ... I have two gardenia plants in 
pots whose leaves are slowly turning yellow.  I hope its not the start 
of the end for them.
I try to exercise when I can, usually in the form of playing, whether it be softball or soccer or golf.

Characterizing Atrial Fibrillation Dynamics using Multiplex Visibility Graphs,"We performed simulations of normal rhythm and fibrillatory dynamics using the mono-domain formulation of the Rogers and McCulloch model. Clinical data were recorded from 4 patients with atrial fibrillation before and after successful catheter ablation procedure using a multi-electrode basket catheter. From multivariate times series of simulated and clinical data, we constructed multiplex visibility graphs. We then compared the structural properties of multiplex visibility graphs between time series from healthy and fibrillatory rhythms. For both simulations and clinical data, the giant component of the multiplex visibility graph was higher in time series of normal rhythm compared to time series of fibrillatory rhythms. The structural efficiency of the multiplex graphs was higher in normal rhythm compared to fibrillatory rhythms. Multiplex visibility graphs provide novel insights in cardiac dynamics, paving the way for a more in-depth characterization of fibrillatory rhythms. In particular, normal sinus rhythm is associated with multiplex visibility graphs that have greater connectivity and structural efficiency compared to fibrillatory dynamics. Our long-term goal is to develop a network-based method that could be used to define procedural end-points and identify alternative therapeutic targets.",,Health,4,Anastasiya Salova,Physics,Physical sciences,"I am a student from Russia currently in a physics PhD program at UC Davis.

Behavioral footprints of depression from mobile-phone usage patterns,"Depression is increasingly prevalent in society. Alone, it a↵ects over 16.1 million American adults and is today the single most pervasive mental illness in the world. Many efforts trying to address this problem leverage technological advancements such as smartphones and smart tracking devices, to facilitate patient self-reporting for use in analyses that can aid medical experts. However, patients frequently ”drop out” or do not self-report, likely a behavior caused by their perpetual depression. This begs the invention of reporting mechanisms that do not rely on active participation from the patient. In this paper, we investigate the relationships between behavioral indicators, measured from smartphone activity, and depression in a large population of highly interconnected young adults. We find that depression correlates strongly with features that indicate social activity, communicational responsiveness and academic attendance. Using this insight we construct a simple classification model that predicts, from their set of behavioral indicators, whether an individual is more or less depressed than the population median. Our results have implications to the future of depression treatment.

Align with my broad research area, I am interested in machine learning, data mining, dynamical system theory, artificial intelligence, computational learning theory, physics of disordered systems, complex networks and related fields.

Currently, my focus is on reservoir computing, which is a new paradigm in neural networks and has shown great performance in non-linear and chaotic signal processing. In contrast to traditional neural networks, in which the system is fine tuned using a learning algorithm to solve a particular task, in reservoir computing a recurrent neural network is initialized and fixed with no further fine tuning. The signal is given to the network and a linear readout layer performs a linear combination of the states to produce the target output. The weights of the linear combination is calculated using linear regression which can be performed in closed form efficiently. My goal is to understand this paradigm better and study what kinds of problems they can and they cannot solve and how the paradigm can be applied to unconventional computing substrates such as nanoscale self-assembled electronics or DNA molecules.

My most recent work on reservoir computing is the direct estimation of error in task solving based on the structure of the dynamical system and statics of the input and output. The approach is currently limited to linear systems but I'm hoping to extend it to nonlinear systems and systems with finite dynamic range.

",Linguistics,Humanities,5,Giovanni Petri,"Engineering, Mathematics",Engineering and engineering trades;Mathematics and statistics,"Hello there, 
formalities first: I am Giovanni Petri, PhD student at the Centre for Transport Studies and the Complexity and Networks group at Imperial College London, my advisors being Prof. J. W. Polak on the engineering side and Prof. H. J. Jensen on the math one. 
You can drop me a Terry Pratchett quote at  gpetri@imperial.ac.uk or click here for the ugly site, or  here for my (slightly better) homepage;
 my  battle with wordpress  for graphic supremacy is ongoing: the site 
is in the making and soonish there might be something resembling a list 
of projects. 
Chit chat now: 
I've always been fascinated by shapes, pattern and regularities, 
belonging to math, the real world or even just ways of thinking. So I 
ended up studying physics to (try and) make sense of all that. I 
completed my MSc in Theoretical Physics with a  thesis about primordial 
structure formation during Inflation, basically the Universe's wrinkles.
 As I was going through it turned out that what thrilled me had a lot in
 common with many issues in complex systems, statistical mechanics and 
the such. 
Making a long story short, I am working on the interfacing of 
information and transportation networks. It looks a long way to go from 
cosmology but -in truth- it’s not. The goal of identifying and 
characterizing extremely non-trivial and involved spatio-temporal 
patterns in a changing space from simple rules can be applied to both 
fields equally well.
Consider, for instance, a model of a traffic network, where cars 
circulate, coupled to an information network, where information 
diffuses. The population on a node influences the        informational state of
 the corresponding node in the information layer. The latter modifies 
the rules by which the cars go around.
What is happening is that you have a bunch of particles changing the 
landscape they are moving in, while the landscape defines where they are
 going to move next. Beyond the technicalities, the picture is not very 
different from early universe particles moving around according to a 
metric, that they contribute to modify as they move.
And if you find some self-organization, then that becomes VERY exciting!
  
Going back to the mundane, I live of short, very strong 
obsessions and these over the years encompassed basketball, tennis, 
squash, football, guitar (still trying, still failing), reading (lots!),
 trekking, video games (Eve Online for the converts), parkour and 
Capoeira. 
The last one, having lasted for quite a while now, is the exception that
 confirms the rule. Also, since there are so many climbers I wouldn't 
mind getting a crash course. No, wait, bad phrasing...
With languages I am slightly better than the average Italian, 
meaning that I can communicate in English, snore in French, had some 
pretty unsettling ""lost in translation"" experiences in German and sing 
(badly) in (poor) Portuguese.  
Oh and in London I'm trying to pick up  British accent and 
self-deprecating humor.

I'm also hoping that I'll find some time to sit around in the New Mexico sun and play ukulele.

"""The limits of my world are the limits of my language"" - An agent-based exploration of the Naming Game in a world of complex context",,Linguistics,Humanities,4,Francois Ascani,Oceanography,Physical sciences,"Hello, I am François and I am a physical oceanographer at the University of Hawai'i. I am finishing my PhD -my defense is a week from the time of writing-, studying the generation of deep mean currents found within a few degrees from the equator below the thermocline depth of 500 m/1500 m feet in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

I am starting also to be interested in marine ecosystems, their population dynamics, assemblage, diversity, evolution, especially at the level of the marine microbes and plankton, either from a species point of view, an individual point of view or from their genetic point of view. I would be very interested in understanding how the theories of complex systems can apply to those marine ecosystems. I have also been working recently in the understanding, validity and use of extremal principles, such as the minimum and maximum entropy production principles; there exist many applications in climate as well as in biology and I would be interested to learn more about those. If valid, their applications are far reaching and could offer an alternative way to model the turbulence in the oceans and atmosphere, the interactions in ecosystems or to reconstruct and predict past and future climate. A small project illustrating the power of such principle could be fun to do.

Overall, I have a good background in the ocean and climate dynamics, mathematics, physics and programming especially with MATLAB. I am also thrilled to discover New Mexico, its traces of the Southwestern Indian Empire, its desert and beautiful scenery. I am looking forward to meet you all and learn more about your individual personal projects.",,Male,Student,University of Hawaii,United States,201-300,2008,Santa Fe,Emily,

Align with my broad research area, I am interested in machine learning, data mining, dynamical system theory, artificial intelligence, computational learning theory, physics of disordered systems, complex networks and related fields.

Currently, my focus is on reservoir computing, which is a new paradigm in neural networks and has shown great performance in non-linear and chaotic signal processing. In contrast to traditional neural networks, in which the system is fine tuned using a learning algorithm to solve a particular task, in reservoir computing a recurrent neural network is initialized and fixed with no further fine tuning. The signal is given to the network and a linear readout layer performs a linear combination of the states to produce the target output. The weights of the linear combination is calculated using linear regression which can be performed in closed form efficiently. My goal is to understand this paradigm better and study what kinds of problems they can and they cannot solve and how the paradigm can be applied to unconventional computing substrates such as nanoscale self-assembled electronics or DNA molecules.

My most recent work on reservoir computing is the direct estimation of error in task solving based on the structure of the dynamical system and statics of the input and output. The approach is currently limited to linear systems but I'm hoping to extend it to nonlinear systems and systems with finite dynamic range. I would be happy to talk about this more to other summer school students and even collaborate on taking it further.",,Male,Student,University of New Mexico,United States,301-400,2014,Santa Fe,Kyle,

 a theoretical physicist. I'm undertaking a PhD at the Nonlinear Physics
 Centre at The Australian National University under the supervision of 
Prof Yuri Kivshar. Most of the group works on nonlinear optics -- 
solitons, optical lattices, nonlinear vortices, etc. really nice 
nonlinear dynamics in other words -- or phenomena with similar equations
 of motion like Bose-Einstein condensates.
I, meanwhile, have been looking at a class of models called 
ratchets. In short these are systems periodic in space and time which 
achieve a nonzero average velocity through breaking of spatial and/or 
temporal symmetry. For example, a particle in a sawtooth potential 
(which is flat on average) under the influence of an additional 
oscillating force (zero on average) which through the combination of 
these forces moves on average in one direction. Such a ratchet could be 
implemented in lots of different areas, but historically the one people 
were focusing on were (processive) molecular motors like myosin-V and 
kinesin which also move without any net bias telling them which way to 
go.
This got me onto molecular motors. I'm not really looking at them
 in a ratchet sense any more. What I have is access to some 
single-molecule time series for their motion (nm in space and us in 
time!), trying to convert this data into an effective equation motion in
 order to uncover details about its dynamics and mechanical structure, 
and comparing against simulations another collaborator is doing.
Is this complex systems? Probably not. I'm looking at everything 
in a rather reductionist manner. In fact, despite having attended some 
other complex systems events, I still don't really know what complex 
systems are. That's one reason I applied to come to the summer school! 
The other reason is that, as you can hopefully tell from the above, I'm 
interested in interdisciplinary work. These sorts of events, and Santa 
Fe in particular, seem to be where people of a like mind tend to hang 
out, so let's meet up and do some collaborating! -- even if it's not 
necessarily on complex systems.

activities, mainly bushwalking (which you'd call hiking or backpacking, I
 think). I'd like to do some while at Santa Fe, it sounds like a great

Scaling of Sensory Information Intake in Organisms,"The metabolic resources required by organisms are known to scale with their mass raised to the 3/4 power. Like energy and nutrients, information about the environment is also a necessary resource for life. However, little attention has been placed on how the capacity to absorb information scales with size. We have taken steps toward answering this question by a) synthesizing data on sensory capacity from multiple organisms to try and answer the question empirically and b) exploring theoretical considerations that might allow us to deduce the scaling laws from first principles. We hypothesize that as organisms increase in size and complexity, their sensory capacity per unit mass decreases, owing to the fact that less total information is needed if it can be processed in a more sophisticated manner. Preliminary results, both theoretical and empirical, are supportive of this claim. In particular, we derive a fundamental bound on the sensory capacity of a spherical cell arising from the heat it dissipates, which turns out to be a linear function of the cell radius r. As the mass of a cell scales as r3, our bound implies that the maximum achievable channel capacity per unit mass decreases with the size of the organism. We also investigate the hypothesis that organisms at all scales devote a fixed fraction of their metabolic rate to gathering sensory information, and find tentative support for this claim.",,Life sciences,2,Louisa Jane Di Felice,Ecology,Life sciences,"I'm a PhD student at the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology in Barcelona.

8-year dataset comprising nearly 20 000 pollinator visitation records, we explore the assembly of plant–pollinator communities at native plant restoration sites in an agricultural landscape. We
find that species occupy highly dynamic network positions through time, causing the assembly process to be punctuated by major network reorganisations. The most persistent pollinator species
are also the most variable in their network positions, contrary to what preferential attachment – the most widely studied theory of ecological network assembly – predicts. Instead, we suggest
assembly occurs via an opportunistic attachment process. Our results contribute to our understanding of how communities assembly and how species interactions change through time while
helping to inform efforts to reassemble robust communities.",,Life sciences,3,Asher Mullokandov,Physics,Physical sciences,"I am a PhD candidate in the Physics department at Boston University.

Evolutionary dynamics of structured genetic algorithms,"This project is still evolving, this paper is a first draft which will be updated. 
Populations are shaped by the spatial structure of their 
environment, it gives rise to a contact structure (interactions between 
individuals) and a population structure (interactions between 
(sub)populations). The topology of structures at both levels can have a 
profound influence on the evolutionary dynamics of a population. Here, 
we present a simple computational model in which genetic algorithms 
evolve cellular automaton rules to perform a classification task with 
which we investigate the evolutionary dynamics of (meta)populations 
consisting of sexually reproducing individuals that crossbreed within 
several distinct contact structures. We find that contact structures -- 
modeled as graphs with various topologies -- that limit the number of 
breeding partners show a higher evolvability and produce individuals 
with a higher fitness than populations with contact structures in which 
individuals have a high number of possible partners. Furthermore, we 
show that well-mixed populations greatly benefit from being subdivided 
into (coupled) subpopulations. Within a metapopulation setting 
well-mixed contact structures can attain a fitness comparable to 
populations with a structured contact structure.

Analysis of Neural Networks Based on Global and Local Sampling of RNA Sequences,"In this work, we use a new sampling approach where we first uniformly sample sequences from different distant parts of the sequence space using RNARedPrint. We then increase the size of the network by locally sampling sequences around each of the sequences sampled at first. In order to keep the network in a reasonable size, we additionally constrain the neutrality criterion such that not only the secondary structure but also the value of its folding energy is considered, using only the lowest 5% of folding energy values. This is done for three different type of structures, an artificial short hairpin structure, a Hammerhead ribozyme and a tRNA. We analyze the structure of the resulting networks and compare with already existing work. We are able to confirm earlier results and show that our sampling technique helps to explore distinct parts of the fitness landscape.

Parallel Agent Based Models,"Agent based models (ABMs) are characterized by purposive intelligent 
agents which interact to yield complex emergent behaviors.  While each 
agent operates with an autonomous localized set of rules, these rules 
typically involve interactions among agents and with the agents’ 
environment, presenting challenges when attempting to simulate very 
large populations of agents.  At the same time, the scaling properties 
of complex adaptive systems are such that it is important to study the 
properties of an ABM over wide ranges of population size.  This is 
because the emergent properties of a system typically change with scope 
and scale: mammalian basal metabolic rate scales sublinearly with animal
 mass, and incidence of crime in a city scales superlinearly with city 
population size.  This presentation describes work proposed towards 
deploying a spatial ABM to a distributed-memory computational cluster.

Complexity in Corn Fields,"Ecological intensification of cropping systems is fundamental to achieve food security under a scenario of rapid population growth and an increasingly un- predictable and changing climate. Agricultural researchers face the challenge to design large throughput, yet sustainable, agricultural systems. Current strate- gies seek to close the the gap between potential and actual yields by increasing the density of plant stands and the availability of resources [7]; however, this gap between rapidly closing. Under this scenario there is need to develop new approaches that accelerate plant breeders success in developing high yielding varieties. Seminal research by Cooper et al. [11] and Hammer et al. [14, 15] provide the foundations for a paradigm shift in genetic improvement of crops with prospects to accelerate the genetic gains in yield. Central to this approach is the quantification of gene-to-phenotype relations by means of mathematical models of crop growth and development, a suit of statistical methods, and an extension of Kaufmans’ N:K model [11, 14, 15, 9, 10].","Agriculture, Economics",Life sciences,2,Charlie Messina,"Biology, Engineering",Life sciences;Physical sciences,"I am a Research Scientist at Pioneer Hi-Bred International, a company that develops and supplies advanced plant genetics worldwide.

John is primarily interested is in the rationalization of city planning and the emerging field of the science of cities, the goal being to apply theory and methods from complex systems science to the research, analysis and design of urban environments. Cities are simultaneously the physical manifestation of buildings and infrastructure or hardware as well as the software and wetware of socio-economic systems and biological-ecological systems. Fractal cartography, cellular automata simulation, genetic algorithms and statistical physics are some of the theoretical components underlying a scientific framework of cities, utilizing technology and information. The science of cities incorporates a variety of frameworks—what Herbert Simon calls the ‘science of the artificial’—such as artificial life, agent based design, systems dynamics, information theory and data mining. With over half the world’s population living in cities and millions more moving to them every year, an understanding of growth and decay patterns in cities as organism-like systems within a broader context is intimately connected with meta-level processes such as global warming and developing long term sustainable and regenerative approaches to design.

How do organisms trade off movement in space (e.g. migration) and in time (e.g. dormancy)?Why and how do organisms synchronize their behavior?How do organisms balance different types of information (e.g. personal, social, genetic) when making decisions?How are groups formed and to what extent to individual retain their identity within a group?How does individual variation result in different behavioral strategies being used?

Exploring the Delay Embedding of an Electroencephalogram Signal,"One can hardly argue against the observation that the brain is a nonlinear system. And yet, most traditional methods of analyzing brain activity, whether recorded by electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or otherwise have tended to stick with linear analysis tools. Much of the reason for this derives from the fact that no one has yet developed a generalized scheme for nonlinear analysis. In this study we adopt a technique for time series analysis known as delay embedding ?. We apply this to a series of EEG scalp recordings. Delay embedding promises to reconstruct the hidden dynamics of a system by revealing a multi-dimensional space topologically equivalent to the internal phase space. However, this promise depends upon a relatively noise-free signal ?. Unfortunately, noise frequently dominates EEG signals recorded from the scalp. In this study, we applied delay embedding to sev- eral EEG signals. The results looked promising at first, but after further analysis, we found that they appear more ambiguous than we originally hoped necessitating further research.","Nonlinear Dynamics, Neuroscience",Life sciences,1,Alessandro Gagliardi,Neuroscience,Social and behavioural science,"Alessandro is a graduate student in the Integrative Neuroscience Program and works in the Rutgers University Mind Brain Analysis (RUMBA) Lab under Stephen Hanson.

RNAnet – A RNA Based Toy Model to Study Biological Networks,"Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) regulate a variety of cellular processes by binding to either other ncRNAs, mRNAs or even DNA. Recent research in this field led to the discovery of several novel classes of ncRNAs and modes of function, such as transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. As a new approach in the study of RNA molecules and their interactions, we construct a network of interacting RNAs as a toy model of regulatory gene network. We use the Vienna RNA package for calculating RNA-RNA cofold structures and we employ these features for defining three classes of interacting agents or “genes”: sensors, transmitters and responders, depending on their folding and cofolding characteristics. We further study the variation of network structure under different environmental conditions by increasing the folding temperature. As a preliminary study of this regulatory network toy-model, we present several possible extensions of the network approach to RNA modeling.",Biology,Life sciences,2,Andreea Munteanu,Physics,Physical sciences," My work during PhD research at UPC centered on the applications of nonlinear dynamics to astrophysics, investigating on the possible chaotic origin of irregular variable stars. At present and after quite a course change, my work as a postdoc at the Complex Systems Lab in Barcelona (with Ricard Solé) concerns the analysis and the conception of biological models associated to a theoretical artificial cell. My work develops in the mark of the PACE European project aiming at the theoretical and experimental realization of a synthetic protocell. I'm very interested in exploring the transition from the chemical to the biological level, including biochemical cycles, spatial pattern formation, emergent robustness and regulation mechanisms in biological systems. Specifically, as tools of this exploration, my present and imediat-future interests are related to computational cell biology, that is (chemical) network analysis as well as improving stochastic spatio-temporal simulations of biochemical systems.

Complexity in Corn Fields,"Ecological intensification of cropping systems is fundamental to achieve food security under a scenario of rapid population growth and an increasingly un- predictable and changing climate. Agricultural researchers face the challenge to design large throughput, yet sustainable, agricultural systems. Current strate- gies seek to close the the gap between potential and actual yields by increasing the density of plant stands and the availability of resources [7]; however, this gap between rapidly closing. Under this scenario there is need to develop new approaches that accelerate plant breeders success in developing high yielding varieties. Seminal research by Cooper et al. [11] and Hammer et al. [14, 15] provide the foundations for a paradigm shift in genetic improvement of crops with prospects to accelerate the genetic gains in yield. Central to this approach is the quantification of gene-to-phenotype relations by means of mathematical models of crop growth and development, a suit of statistical methods, and an extension of Kaufmans’ N:K model [11, 14, 15, 9, 10].","Agriculture, Economics",Life sciences,2,Arturo Chavoya,Computer Science,Computing;Life sciences,"I am originally from Mexico and at present I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the Ecole Doctorale en Informatique et Télécommunications in Toulouse, France.

My Master in research was on the subject of Freudian Overdetermination in the light of the scientific revolutions brought on by Complex Systems and Chaos, in addition to Ilya Prigogine’s contributions.

I have been doing clinical work in institutions and private practice since 2007, and have also worked on the field of prevention, doing harm reduction talks and workshops, as well as statistics. I have spoken publicly (radio and television, public gatherings and seminars) and have presented scientific communications on my research around the world (so far in France, Australia and Mexico).

Research interests
My research interests aim at integrating dynamical and complex systems’ views in psychology (epistemology-wise as well as in clinical practice). I particularly focus on fractals and their relation to psychoanalysis and psychic phenomena in clinical settings, but also taking into account neuroscience, sociology, linguistics and behavior. Outside of traditional human sciences, I have focused on fractals, attractors, self-similarity, nodes, dissipative systems, phase transitions and feedback loops. This multidisciplinary approach sheds light on clinical treatment, repetition, symptoms, projection, bodily manifestations and psychopathological structures such as autism, psychosis, neurosis and their relation to the culture they are engrained in.

Current Research
I am currently doing my PH.D. at the Center for Research in Psychoanalysis, Medicine and Society at the University of Paris 7, Sorbonne-Cité, Denis-Diderot. My focus is on Fractals and the Psyche; repetition, structure and self-similarity. This research contributes to clinical, as well as epistemological aspects in the field of psychology. Fractals seem to be a key to understanding repetitive symptoms and maladaptive response systems, crucial factors for the efficiency of therapy. On the other hand, I strive to integrate recent developments of complex systems, chaos theory, and specifically fractal geometry in my field. Some efforts to explore this multidisciplinary junction have already been explored around the world with promising results, but it seems we have just seen the tip of the iceberg in a field where there is still much to do.

Effects of Nutrient Limitation on the Dynamics of an Estuarine Food Web,"Estuaries are defined by their shifting salinity and nutrients, yet food web models rarely incorporate these impacts on producers. This study combined a box model of abiotic conditions with a food web model of trophic levels to study how nutrient limitation affects Chesapeake Bay biota. Using ac- tual data, the model tested the hypothesis that nutrient limitation affects lower trophic levels more than higher ones. Without nutrient limitation, the entire food web persisted with higher abundances of species directly feed- ing on trophic level one. Nutrient limitation reduced phytoplankton GPP, but those consumers not directly feeding on phytoplankton were hurt most by reduced GPP, counter to predictions. Additionally, the model predicts that reductions in silica suppress diatom populations, which again affects indirectly-linked species most strongly. The generally greater effects of nu- trient limitation, and corresponding GPP suppression, on species indirectly linked to phytoplankton may be due to a magnification of trophic transfer inefficiency along food chains. However, as the silica example shows, limita- tion of specific nutrients will have an asymmetric affect on the Chesapeake Bay food web because those species trophically linked to species dependent on the nutrient will be affected more than species not linked to affected pro- ducers. This model illustrates the utility of basing producer growth rates to actual nutrient fluctuations in given environments, a step toward realistic food-web modelling of Chesapeake Bay and other estuaries.",Marine Sciences,Life sciences,2,Sandra Arndt,Marine Sciences,Physical sciences,"I am a PhD student in the Reactive Transport Group at the University of Utrecht, the Netherlands.

Research-wise, I am currently interested in two things: (1) emergence and stability of cooperative or mutually advantageous behavior and (2) decision-making under risk and uncertainty. In particular, I am interested in the application of these two research areas to questions in political philosophy and philosophy of science. For example, how can the design of social and political institutions solve social dilemmas and when is coercion justified? Or, what principles of justice would we choose if we did not know how wealthy our parents will be and what native abilities we will be lucky to have? These intersect with questions in philosophy of science; for example, what probabilistic inferences should we draw from our experiences and was Popper right to be an inductive skeptic? (These questions are, of course, also relevant to epistemology and to statistical learning theory.) From time to time, I also worry about the robustness of computational models. Recently, as a way to intermittently procrastinate while studying for my comps, I have also taken a keen interest in urban planning/geography, especially the relationship between walkability, population density and urban spatial structure.

Opportunistic attachment assembles plant–pollinator networks,"Species and interactions are being lost at alarming rates and it is imperative to understand how communities assemble if we have to prevent their collapse and restore lost interactions. Using an
8-year dataset comprising nearly 20 000 pollinator visitation records, we explore the assembly of plant–pollinator communities at native plant restoration sites in an agricultural landscape. We
find that species occupy highly dynamic network positions through time, causing the assembly process to be punctuated by major network reorganisations. The most persistent pollinator species
are also the most variable in their network positions, contrary to what preferential attachment – the most widely studied theory of ecological network assembly – predicts. Instead, we suggest
assembly occurs via an opportunistic attachment process. Our results contribute to our understanding of how communities assembly and how species interactions change through time while

Diversification in Simulated Food Webs: The Role of Closed Motifs,"We allow a simulated food web to self-construct by repeated introduction
 of predators. Networks start with a source of biomass, and predators 
choose their prey according to a niche model. Species thrive or go 
extinct according to a standard predator-prey biomass model. We examine 
the correlation between structural motifs and the evolution of network 
architecture. We find two motifs that correlate strongly with network 
expansion, and we speculate casually but optimistically on implications 
and further research possibilities.

Scaling of Sensory Information Intake in Organisms,"The metabolic resources required by organisms are known to scale with their mass raised to the 3/4 power. Like energy and nutrients, information about the environment is also a necessary resource for life. However, little attention has been placed on how the capacity to absorb information scales with size. We have taken steps toward answering this question by a) synthesizing data on sensory capacity from multiple organisms to try and answer the question empirically and b) exploring theoretical considerations that might allow us to deduce the scaling laws from first principles. We hypothesize that as organisms increase in size and complexity, their sensory capacity per unit mass decreases, owing to the fact that less total information is needed if it can be processed in a more sophisticated manner. Preliminary results, both theoretical and empirical, are supportive of this claim. In particular, we derive a fundamental bound on the sensory capacity of a spherical cell arising from the heat it dissipates, which turns out to be a linear function of the cell radius r. As the mass of a cell scales as r3, our bound implies that the maximum achievable channel capacity per unit mass decreases with the size of the organism. We also investigate the hypothesis that organisms at all scales devote a fixed fraction of their metabolic rate to gathering sensory information, and find tentative support for this claim.",,Life sciences,2,Elan Stopnitzky,Physics,Physical sciences,"My research sits at the intersection of information theory, statistical physics, and biology.

Effects of Nutrient Limitation on the Dynamics of an Estuarine Food Web,"Estuaries are defined by their shifting salinity and nutrients, yet food web models rarely incorporate these impacts on producers. This study combined a box model of abiotic conditions with a food web model of trophic levels to study how nutrient limitation affects Chesapeake Bay biota. Using ac- tual data, the model tested the hypothesis that nutrient limitation affects lower trophic levels more than higher ones. Without nutrient limitation, the entire food web persisted with higher abundances of species directly feed- ing on trophic level one. Nutrient limitation reduced phytoplankton GPP, but those consumers not directly feeding on phytoplankton were hurt most by reduced GPP, counter to predictions. Additionally, the model predicts that reductions in silica suppress diatom populations, which again affects indirectly-linked species most strongly. The generally greater effects of nu- trient limitation, and corresponding GPP suppression, on species indirectly linked to phytoplankton may be due to a magnification of trophic transfer inefficiency along food chains. However, as the silica example shows, limita- tion of specific nutrients will have an asymmetric affect on the Chesapeake Bay food web because those species trophically linked to species dependent on the nutrient will be affected more than species not linked to affected pro- ducers. This model illustrates the utility of basing producer growth rates to actual nutrient fluctuations in given environments, a step toward realistic food-web modelling of Chesapeake Bay and other estuaries.",Marine Sciences,Life sciences,2,William Burnside,Biology,Life sciences,"I'm a first-year PhD student in biology at the U. of New Mexico working with Jim Brown.

Analysis of Neural Networks Based on Global and Local Sampling of RNA Sequences,"In this work, we use a new sampling approach where we first uniformly sample sequences from different distant parts of the sequence space using RNARedPrint. We then increase the size of the network by locally sampling sequences around each of the sequences sampled at first. In order to keep the network in a reasonable size, we additionally constrain the neutrality criterion such that not only the secondary structure but also the value of its folding energy is considered, using only the lowest 5% of folding energy values. This is done for three different type of structures, an artificial short hairpin structure, a Hammerhead ribozyme and a tRNA. We analyze the structure of the resulting networks and compare with already existing work. We are able to confirm earlier results and show that our sampling technique helps to explore distinct parts of the fitness landscape.

Opportunistic attachment assembles plant–pollinator networks,"Species and interactions are being lost at alarming rates and it is imperative to understand how communities assemble if we have to prevent their collapse and restore lost interactions. Using an
8-year dataset comprising nearly 20 000 pollinator visitation records, we explore the assembly of plant–pollinator communities at native plant restoration sites in an agricultural landscape. We
find that species occupy highly dynamic network positions through time, causing the assembly process to be punctuated by major network reorganisations. The most persistent pollinator species
are also the most variable in their network positions, contrary to what preferential attachment – the most widely studied theory of ecological network assembly – predicts. Instead, we suggest
assembly occurs via an opportunistic attachment process. Our results contribute to our understanding of how communities assembly and how species interactions change through time while
helping to inform efforts to reassemble robust communities.",,Life sciences,3,Marilia P.

RNAnet – A RNA Based Toy Model to Study Biological Networks,"Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) regulate a variety of cellular processes by binding to either other ncRNAs, mRNAs or even DNA. Recent research in this field led to the discovery of several novel classes of ncRNAs and modes of function, such as transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. As a new approach in the study of RNA molecules and their interactions, we construct a network of interacting RNAs as a toy model of regulatory gene network. We use the Vienna RNA package for calculating RNA-RNA cofold structures and we employ these features for defining three classes of interacting agents or “genes”: sensors, transmitters and responders, depending on their folding and cofolding characteristics. We further study the variation of network structure under different environmental conditions by increasing the folding temperature.

Analysis of Neural Networks Based on Global and Local Sampling of RNA Sequences,"In this work, we use a new sampling approach where we first uniformly sample sequences from different distant parts of the sequence space using RNARedPrint. We then increase the size of the network by locally sampling sequences around each of the sequences sampled at first. In order to keep the network in a reasonable size, we additionally constrain the neutrality criterion such that not only the secondary structure but also the value of its folding energy is considered, using only the lowest 5% of folding energy values. This is done for three different type of structures, an artificial short hairpin structure, a Hammerhead ribozyme and a tRNA. We analyze the structure of the resulting networks and compare with already existing work. We are able to confirm earlier results and show that our sampling technique helps to explore distinct parts of the fitness landscape. We also show that local minima consist of more than one sequence and low folding energy sequences are spread throughout the network and separated by sequences with higher folding energy.",,Life sciences,4,Jacob P.

Inferring Functional Taxonomy from Network Structure,"The projection of bipartite graphs has proven to be a useful tool to infer similarity measures between nodes of either one of the node types, based on how many links they share with nodes of another type. In economics this has lead to the concept of the product space (Hidalgo et al. 2007), which is a network that connects products based on their co-locations in different countries. The relatedness between products in this networks is thought to be representative of the ’capabilities’ that are required to produce such products. Here we apply similar concepts to plant-pollinator networks and evaluate the results in light of natural history. By projecting plant-pollinator networks onto plant-plant and pollinator-pollinator networks, we aim to derive a measure of relatedness between plants based on the ecological traits that a pollinator must have to feed on it, and likewise a measure of relatedness between pollinators in terms of the traits they share, that allow them to feed on the same plants. By running community detection algorithms on the projected networks we create a functional taxonomy based on these (unobserved) ecological traits, and compare this taxonomy to taxonomies based on observable traits. As opposed to evolutionary taxonomies, our inferred taxonomies can represent a ’partner space,’ describing how plants see their pollinator community in terms of their capabilities and vice versa. Trait-based community detection formalizes the concept of ’pollination syndromes,’ the idea that pollinators in a pollination network with similar traits prefer similar plants with similar traits (e.g. flies pollinators prefer white-flowered plants) (Willmer 2011). We find that detected communities (Figure 1) are well-aligned with pollination guilds formed from field observations of flower visitors but that most basic (empirically-recorded) plant traits are not predictive of the communities observed from the projected plant-pollinator networks, suggesting that other traits play a significant role in plant choice for pollinators.

I am currently a Ph.D. Student in Computational Neuroscience at 
the University of California, San Diego and the Salk Institute for 
Biological Studies.  I will be graduating this winter.  My thesis work 
is focused on quantitatively characterizing neural arbor shape in terms 
of probability density functions.  Because fitting a function to a 
neural arbor is hard, I measure the moments of the arbors directly from 3
 dimensionally reconstructed neurons (A probability density function can
 be described by it's moments).  Investigation of neural arbor moments 
reveal that arbors are statistically self similar to one another.  
Statistical self similarity reveals that neural arbors density functions
 have the same basic shape.  It also reveals the  parameters that are 
needed to characterize the probability density function of an arbor.  I 
investigate different pre-classified types of arbors in terms of these 
parameters and show that there are differences between different types 
of arbors but there is a lot of overlap between them.
My thesis work has involved techniques from neuroscience, physics
 (derivation of scaling relationship in arbors), biostatistics & 
machine learning (data analysis, probability density estimation, cluster
 analysis), data mining (extracting information from a large data base 
of neurons), signal processing (spike train analysis) and experimental 
electrophysiology (measuring ion channel conductances).

In economics this has lead to the concept of the product space (Hidalgo et al. 2007), which is a network that connects products based on their co-locations in different countries. The relatedness between products in this networks is thought to be representative of the ’capabilities’ that are required to produce such products. Here we apply similar concepts to plant-pollinator networks and evaluate the results in light of natural history. By projecting plant-pollinator networks onto plant-plant and pollinator-pollinator networks, we aim to derive a measure of relatedness between plants based on the ecological traits that a pollinator must have to feed on it, and likewise a measure of relatedness between pollinators in terms of the traits they share, that allow them to feed on the same plants. By running community detection algorithms on the projected networks we create a functional taxonomy based on these (unobserved) ecological traits, and compare this taxonomy to taxonomies based on observable traits. As opposed to evolutionary taxonomies, our inferred taxonomies can represent a ’partner space,’ describing how plants see their pollinator community in terms of their capabilities and vice versa. Trait-based community detection formalizes the concept of ’pollination syndromes,’ the idea that pollinators in a pollination network with similar traits prefer similar plants with similar traits (e.g. flies pollinators prefer white-flowered plants) (Willmer 2011). We find that detected communities (Figure 1) are well-aligned with pollination guilds formed from field observations of flower visitors but that most basic (empirically-recorded) plant traits are not predictive of the communities observed from the projected plant-pollinator networks, suggesting that other traits play a significant role in plant choice for pollinators. This indicates the non-trivial nature of the communities identified by looking at plant-pollinator networks, reinforces criticisms of pollination syndromes, and may inspire future ecological research such as the identification of characteristic ecological traits that form these communities.",,Life sciences;Computing,4,Surendra Hazarie,Physics,Physical sciences,A second year physics graduate student from Rochester; interested in practical applications of physics to human-based studies.

To do this, I try to quantify how knowledge recombines, the distance between knowledge and the complexity of knowledge using network and information theory. In practice, knowledge is measured through e.g. products, services, patents or occupations. Relatedness can then be measured through co-location or co-classifications, and complexity can be measured by for example the ease of recombination. I am also interested in explaining why complex knowledge scales with city size (in other words, is concentrated in space). I do this by measuring interdependencies between occupations and trying to quantify synergies and redundancies between occupations.

Topological analysis of idealized and empirical fitness landscapes,"In this work, we provide such summary statistics using the tools of topological data analysis, in particular based on the technique of persistent homology.

Predicting Time Series of Complex System,"Scientists have a predilection for finding patterns and establishing relationships in the world around them. One way of doing this is simply by taking mea- surements of a quantifiable aspect (e.g. temperature, distance, voltage, etc) of the observable system. Such investigations were labor-intensive and highly susceptible to human and measurement error. Once the data was collected, the scientist had to infer a model of the phenomena from the data. The mathemat- ical tools we had to describe phenomena were based on the assumption that the underlying behavior could be described by a line, or it could be made to if you squint hard enough. This is not true, however, about nonlinear systems, whose behavior, before the advent of nonlinear tools and methods, could be charac- terized only as erratic or chaotic. Technology has enabled us to gather copious amount of accurate data about an observable system. We are able to capture subtle changes in dynamics in short intervals of time. It has also motivated us to refine (or overhaul as the case may be) methods for characterizing the behavior. In this paper we explore one such method, time delay embedding, and its application to two chaotic systems.","Nonlinear Dynamics, Computer Science (?)",Mathematics and statistics,3,Lukas Kroc,Computer Science,Computing,"I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Cornell University.

Under the supervision of Prof. Hiroshi Kokubu, my thesis topic is on finding a lower bound for the topological entropy of multivalued maps coming from a time series of an unknown dynamical system. Understanding time series is crucial if we want to know something about how the true but unknown underlying system that drives it behaves. The method of estimation is by means of a multivalued map obtained from a time series and showing a horseshoe-like dynamics present in this map. The notion of symbolic dynamics and phase-space reconstruction play crucial roles as well.

Just very recently, I've been interested in studying coupled cell networks (mainly focusing on the works of Martin Golubitsky). Given a system of ODEs, by restricting to the polydiagonal subspace, can we say something about the network architecture of the original system?

Predicting Time Series of Complex System,"Scientists have a predilection for finding patterns and establishing relationships in the world around them. One way of doing this is simply by taking mea- surements of a quantifiable aspect (e.g. temperature, distance, voltage, etc) of the observable system. Such investigations were labor-intensive and highly susceptible to human and measurement error. Once the data was collected, the scientist had to infer a model of the phenomena from the data. The mathemat- ical tools we had to describe phenomena were based on the assumption that the underlying behavior could be described by a line, or it could be made to if you squint hard enough. This is not true, however, about nonlinear systems, whose behavior, before the advent of nonlinear tools and methods, could be charac- terized only as erratic or chaotic. Technology has enabled us to gather copious amount of accurate data about an observable system. We are able to capture subtle changes in dynamics in short intervals of time. It has also motivated us to refine (or overhaul as the case may be) methods for characterizing the behavior. In this paper we explore one such method, time delay embedding, and its application to two chaotic systems.","Nonlinear Dynamics, Computer Science (?)",Mathematics and statistics,3,David Rojas,Mathematics,Mathematics and statistics,"Hi all!

I completed my Stanford University PhD in September 2012 with a dissertation entitled, “Aligning Complex, Adaptive Systems Theory and Data-Limited Assessment Strategies for Improved Fisheries Management.” During the completion of my Stanford PhD and the work that I performed during this period, I focused upon integrative fisheries management to bridge the gaps between regulators, scientists, and fishermen. This involved explicit consideration of optimal sampling designs and data collection protocols for long-term monitoring and evaluation of California’s network of marine protected areas. For years, I hoped to attend the Santa Fe Institute’s Complex Systems Summer School (CSSS) but was previously committed with PhD fieldwork and SCUBA diving to count fish each summer—until now! Today, I work for a private firm, Integrated Statistics, but my office is at NOAA headquarters in Silver Spring, MD. I work on NOAA’s Large Marine Ecosystems program, which is complex, adaptive systems and adaptive management in action!

As further motivation and enthusiasm for CSSS 2013, I am keenly interested in disease ecology. My interest stems from my own Lyme disease misdiagnosis and the ineffectiveness of conventional medical treatments. To fully heal myself and recover, I resorted to collaborating with other researchers and medical doctors to pioneer a novel treatment protocol using experimental nano-mineral treatments to facilitate antibiotic delivery across the blood-brain barrier, combat intracellular infection, and dissolve biofilms. It involves intravenous treatment with nano-silver, nano-gold, and trace minerals (oligotherapy), energetically treated by a plasma arc to increase resonance potential and efficacy. No doubt, my willingness to use my own body as a guinea pig was a risk—but a calculated risk that ultimately paid off by returning my health to 100% capacity. My decision to take such a personal risk was deeply rooted in basic science and empirical data, combined with my knowledge of the human body as its own ecosystem with resilience, hysteresis, and multi-system dynamics with synergistic properties. Hence, my training in complex, adaptive systems indirectly helped return me to life.

My experience with infectious disease science is distinct from my marine ecosystem expertise but both our human bodies and the oceans are complex, adaptive systems with non-linear dynamics and multiple stable states.

The seismic reliability of the substations (nodes) was evaluated under the impact of earthquake. Power flow (load flow) analysis was conducted on the hypothetical power network. The most vulnerable (critical) edges and nodes were evaluated with complex network theory.

Fluctuations in 1D Point Patterns,"Random point patterns with similar apparent characteristics (such as density of points) may display very different behaviours when it comes to the way these points are distributed in space. Strongly negatively correlated points (e.g. due to repulsive forces) show a high degree of order, whereas strongly positively correlated points (e.g. due to attractive forces) show clustering and hence, a high degree of disorder. These two extreme cases define a spectrum where point patterns are classified according to their fluctuations from small fluctuations (order, hyperuniformity) to large fluctuations (disorder, clustering). Point patterns with weak correlations show the same trend in their fluctuations as the typical uncorrelated case and are said to display Poisson-like behaviour. In this report, we show numerical results on different one-dimensional point patterns both computer generated and experimentally obtained (heartbeat recordings). Furthermore, we regard the case of anomalously suppressed fluctuations (hyperuniformity) as a case of special interest and we try to derive the underlying mechanisms that give rise to this behaviour.

He is a mechanical engineer and has always been interested in operation of human brain and the use of brain theory principles in human made intelligence systems. So in his graduate studies he set out on a journey to build a brain for an energy distribution system. The brain’s primary role would be to predict short term energy consumption of its clients from past experience and estimate the risk of prediction error. Based on this the system would determine its economically optimal operation. That would assure the system operating costs would be as low as possible while all the clients energy needs would be satisfied. After a successful birth of the first prediction brain an entrepreneurial bug bit him so he set out to use the prediction brains commercially in several district energy distribution systems.

The developed brains were using simulated neural networks and genetic algorithms to solve their tasks. But Marko still was not satisfied with the intelligence capabilities his brains were having. So now he is starting to examine the use of more sophisticated brain theory principles to autonomously solve given problems. He is especially interested in using Jeff Hawkins’ memory-prediction framework of the brain (Hierarchical Temporal Memory) for intelligent extraction of information from past experience. To effectively use this framework he needs to have more knowledge in the fields of neuroscience, dynamics of complex systems, etc. Armed with this knowledge maybe some day he will be able to answer his favorite problem of how to develop an intelligent system that autonomously extracts and understands the information available on the internet.

Whenever Marko is tired of playing with his artificial intelligence buddies he loves to interact and communicate with other people. In his free time he also practices some weird sport of golf, runs a lot and tries to devote as much time as possible to his princess.

Now he is setting out on a journey half across the world to a beautiful small town of Santa Fe to conquer new knowledge, form new friendships and have an unforgettable experience.

The title of my dissertation was ""Understanding the interplay of structure and dynamics in neuronal networks"", and much of my research has focused on questions in the field of neuroscience. Networks are very important in this field as the brain is a prime example of a very complicated network. Important features of neuronal networks are that the nodes (neurons) are dynamic due to the firing of action potentials, and the edges (synapses) are constantly evolving. The main part of my dissertation focused on a new clustering algorithm that utilizes these neuronal dynamics to detect groupings of neurons with similar firing patterns. I think that studying networks with dynamic nodes will become increasingly important as we try to apply network theory to more types of networks. Since neuronal networks can be viewed as time series of discrete events, I'd like to extend this line of thinking to types of networks outside of neuroscience, and I'm hoping that this workshop will be a good place to do so. In addition to the algorithm development and subsequent data analysis, much of my time in graduate school was spent doing experimental work growing dissociated hippocampal cultures and studying how the underlying structure of these networks influences their dynamics. I also spent some time doing computational modeling of epilepsy where I studied two coupled networks of neurons and looked at resonance and driving relationships between the networks as one network transitioned into seizure dynamics.

But, I have broad interests and am eager to learn more this June about the applications you have for complexity science in your own research, and how this may overlap into issues in mine.

I'm interested in complexity science because I think it might shed some light on some longstanding questions in marine phytoplankton ecology. It seems odd how algae, being photosynthetic, are able to survive in the ocean when their light environment fluctuates so dramatically. Why is it that what works best in the most complex light environment is contained in possibly the most simple photosynthetic organisms. What strategies do phytoplankton employ for survival? How can we learn about these strategies, given the few photosynthetic properties that we can measure in the natural environment?",,Male,Postdoc,Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,United States,Not University,2008,Santa Fe,Emily,

Complex voices: clinical applications of non linear measures,,Medicine,Medicine,2,Riccardo Fusaroli,"Semiotics, Linguistics",Humanities,"Hej everyone, I am currently holding a joint postdoctoral position at Aarhus University, shared between two projects: - Joint Diagrammatical Reasoning in language, at the Center for Semiotics, investigating linguistic dynamics and symbolic evolution in cooperative problem solving experimental tasks. - Digging for the roots of understanding, at the Center of Functionally Integrative Neuroscience investigating the role of material objects (e.g. Lego) in the co-construction of common ground. The common ground of these projects is that I manipulate the conditions at which dyads and groups interact in solving problems (mostly in quasi-ecological settings). I then quantify different properties of the coordination (heart rate synchronization, prosodic patterning, turn-taking rhythms, linguistic alignment, coordinative social strategies, etc), trying to predict performance and, in one paradigm, the neural traces (fMRI) of the coordination. I recently started a new clinical project trying to automatically classify different populations (schizophrenia, asperger's, depression, etc.) from the dynamics in their prosody.

I am mostly interested in new ways to quantify and model human interactions at their different coordinative levels, from physiological synchronization to the ones involving the symbolic and material aspects of language and objects. I bring expertise in human interactions, as well as in collecting experimentally constrained empirical data involving them. I am looking forward to learn and discuss different methods to analyze coordination, especially in groups with more than 2 interacting agents. I would also love to learn how to simulate my empirical data, so to constrain the space of possible parameters involved, and to investigate the cultural evolution of coordinative patterns.

Evolution and dynamics of reaction networks,"Complexity underpins the very nature of known chemical interactions. In this paper, we offer a simulation-based model that mimics the behavior of a generic chemical reaction network. Using ideas from complex systems, we seed and evolve this reaction network with the view to study its dynamics and changing topology over time. Our simulation model allows for two sets of scenarios - the most minimal assumption of additive reactions between molecules only and the more complicated, more realistic assumption that allows for branching reactions to take place. Our results show behavior that we would expect – given a constant inflow of generic nutrients, after time eventually a steady-state system is realized. In the scenario where branching is permitted, the time to steady-state is delayed slightly due to the presence of apparent slower dynamics.

I’m interested in the chemical evolution of the universe, in particular in the transition from ‘prebiotic’ interstellar chemistry to biological chemistry in living organisms on Earth. In a more general sense, I am fascinated by complex behavior and how it emerges and evolves in Nature, and feel that the emergence of life is a natural expression of universal principles governing complex systems. I hope to learn more about some of these principles and the tools to study them this summer and I hope that by interacting with people from many different fields I gain a better perspective on how to apply these ideas to my own research.

I'm also a Ph.D student in the Communications Research (CoRe) Group at Uppsala University.

My broad research area is computer systems and networking. I'm currently studying communication in autonomous wireless networks and trying to address the problem of energy-efficient coordination of access to the shared wireless channel in a multihop wireless environment, such as ad hoc and sensor networks. I especially enjoy working on problems where I can do practical system implementation and experimentation work and look at the system behavior analytically, as well.

I applied to attend the summer school because I think it may be interesting to think about the problem of coordinating channel access in a complex systems context. In a multihop wireless network, contention and interference effects generally extend further than the data communication range. As a result, senders have to decide when to transmit, despite having incomplete knowledge of both conflicting transmissions and the impact of their transmissions on the network.

So one of my goals this summer is to learn about complex systems techniques to see whether there is some interesting way to model the problem of coordinating channel access. But I'm also excited to learn from and collaborate with people working on all sorts of interesting problems...

I'm excited to meet you all shortly and I am happy to 
be part of this group.  I became interested in the subject through 
undergraduate and graduate research on environmental change and the 
implications for social systems.  I recently graduated from the 
University for Peace (in Costa Rica) where I did my MA in Environmental 
Security and Peace.  My thesis used complex systems theories to explore 
the types of management structures used for measurement and evaluation 
of environmental peacemaking programs.  I generally found that the 
organizational structures were too rigid to sustain long-term programs. 
 I think I really became interested in the topic when I picked up Panarchy
 by Gunderson and Holling.  This book influenced the way I thought about
 organization and change in the environment (excluding humans) and the 
similarities that can be drawn to social systems.  Also, the Complex Forest
 by Carol Colfer, was a great example of trying to apply the theories 
through participatory action research.  I am now finishing up work with 
an international development organization where I was helping to build 
robust, multi-stakeholder development programs that could withstand 
perturbations in the economic, political, and social arenas.
There are several things that I would like to look at during this summer program:

How complex adaptive systems modeling can better inform environmental peacemaking initiatives;Social system hierarchies and points where change can occur;The differences between systems that move towards optimization and those that move towards improvement;Creating Boolean functions that reflect an adaptive approach to environmental management and the constraints in doing so;and a larger interest of mine is how does spirituality fit into all of this?
My expertise will come mostly from my background in real-world 
applications of complex adaptive systems theories.  I hope that by the 
end of the summer I will have a better sense of how CS could provide 
alternative management systems for environmental peacemaking projects.  I
 am also eager to learn about how people in other fields will view and 
use this knowledge.  I do not have a concrete idea for a project just 
yet but I am looking forward to coming up with projects in such an 
interdisciplinary group.

I am currently a graduate student at Georgetown University in the Communication, Culture, and Technology Program. I have not chosen a specific topic for my thesis yet, but my interests include the effects of technology on society (both past and present), the problem of information overload in society and how we might create new ways of processing information to make it more manageable, and developing a more interconnected approach to globalization studies that reflects how each element of globalization effects the other. I see complexity theory relating to each of these interests in different ways. With respect to the effects of technology on society, technological innovation and diffusion has followed the traditional S shaped curve and has been shown to mimic the Kondratiev wave. If these patterns are studied more in-depthly it might be possible to make more accurate projections about whether the rate of technological growth and innovation will remain the same or increase in the future. In terms of information overload, I think complexity theory can offer news ways of classifying how ""complex"" a given piece of information is and offer the simplest way of navigating it. Visual simulations of complex information can also offer a new and more easily digestible format, the same way a traditional x-y graph makes it easier to see the behavior and draw conclusions about a function. Finally, up until this point globalization studies have focused on specific parts of globalization such as economics or culture, but there has yet to be an approach that tries to see how all aspects of globalization are connected and effect one another. I think complexity theory offers the best method for trying to synthesize these different areas and creating a more holistic approach, viewing globalization as more of a complex adaptive system. I do not come from a math or computer science background, so my knowledge of each area is very limited. I have been brushing up on calculus and differential equations for the past month and hope that I have learned enough to at least be able to speak the language, but any help from my fellow summer programmers would be greatly appreciated.

One short story is that I'm interested in evolution, network science, mathematics, computer science, and language. A longer story is that in light of an internal struggle that I believe has explicitly confronted thinkers, at the least since Kant, my approach to research teeters about the fulcrum between rationalism and empiricism with respect to the order in which each is applied in attempts to cultivate knowledge. My scientific research interests began with synthetic biology and the study of bacterial quorum sensing and broadened from there to include systems biology and the evolution of multicellularity. I am now primarily interested in applying, as yet abstract, tools from mathematics and theoretical computer science to a mereological description of the evolution of hierarchical organization in biological systems that incorporates niche construction with selection in order to derive a more concrete computational model of such. In this context, and being at least a token ontological reductionist, I am also interested in the hierarchical relationship between information representation in molecular and linguistic forms as may be addressed at the level of abstraction of semiotics.

The Effect of Leverage on Financial Markets,"When people get excited about their prospects on the stock market, they 
borrow money from the bank to invest. This leverage effectively couples 
the bank to the stock market. Thus, interest rates determine demand for 
stock, and demand for stock can determine interest rates. Does this 
interplay cause traders to naturally find a stable balance of leverage 
and aggressiveness? How do the behavioral traits of traders influence 
the stability of these interactions? Are there regulatory behaviors, 
such as limiting leverage or slowing margin calls, that would contribute
 to the overall health of the market?  We present an economy consisting 
of a banking sector and an equity market, with traders transferring 
money between the two.  Using an agent-based model, we will be able to 
examine how leverage couples the bank to the equities market.  
Furthermore, we can explore how different leverage strategies effects 
the stability of these markets.

Human Path Finding in a Semantic Word Game,"Human decision-making processes are inevitably influenced by mental images, which are triggered by cues such as objects,
concepts, and words. The cognitive associations between words can be captured and represented as a semantic network,
in which words represent nodes and association between words are edges. How efficiently can humans traverse this word
association network to a given target word if, at each moment, they can only make choices about the next word they will visit?
Using participant traversal data from the appropriately designed semantic game MindPaths, we show that human players
do not rely on guessing, but navigate this association network quite efficiently, finding a specified target word often in the
minimal number of steps. We construct models to capture human paths within the MindPaths game. We find that similarity in
overall game length is easy to achieve with a trained random walker. We then consider a model of individual choices using
Bayesian estimation of transition probabilities conditional on local network connectivity. We find that it is difficult to capture the
individual decisions or the decision making process of human players. More complex models driven by semantic similarities
and other types of relations between words are necessary to fully understand how individuals choose a particular path within
this semantic word game.",,Social and behavioural science,3,Frank Marrs,Statistics,Mathematics and statistics,"I am a first-year Statistics PhD student at Colorado State University.

The Coevolution of Residential and Friendship Networks: An Extension of the Schelling Model,"During the past few decades social network analysis has produced a great
 deal of insight into the workings of social systems. While social 
scientists have put a lot of work into the investigation of residential,
 friendship, trust, exchange or discussion networks, scientific inquiry 
has typically limited itself to investigating the characteristics of 
networks of only one kind. This approach has produced plentiful insight 
on the structure and function of different kinds of social networks, but
 the interaction between the different kinds of social networks has 
received insufficient investigation so far. Our work, in which we 
examine the interaction of residential and social networks represents an
 attempt at advancing this field of inquiry. More specifically, we 
extend a classic model of residential segregation (Schelling, 1968) by 
incorporating a social network that constructs -- and is influenced by 
-- residential preferences. We use Agent-Based Modelling to examine how 
social network topology affects residential segregation in the Schelling
 model. Given its current popularity in social simulation, extending the
 Schelling model is an important task in its own right, but we seek to 
achieve something more fundamental than a mere rehashing of an old 
model. We deploy Schelling's model as the basis for a way to understand 
multiplex networks, and seek to give a formal, methodologically 
practicable expression to Granovetter's concept of embeddedness.

Talking Loud Or Talking Often: How the Interplay Between Network Structure and Agent Influence Affects the Time to Reach Consensus in Collective Decision-Making,"Consensus-seeking processes are core mechanisms for social organization in non-human animal groups, human societies, artificial and multi-agent systems. Such processes consist of a series of negotiations between individuals, which ultimately aggregate different individual opinions into one common agreed decision. Related works have shown that a small number of influential and highly centralized agents i.e. leaders, considerably speed up the consensus-seeking process. Yet the important features of hierarchy and leaders have not been clearly identified and their investigation in experiments provide contradictory evidence. To disentangle these effects, we separate two features of hierarchy (i) the level of centralization ν and (ii) the number of leaders NL, i.e. influential individuals. We therefore developed a continuous opinion formation model to explore the effect of each feature and their interplay on the time to reach a global consensus. The results show that the most important feature is the topology of the network structure, with higher centralization always decreasing the time to reach consensus. In addition, it also demonstrates that the effect of influential individuals are deeply entangled with the underlying network structure. Indeed, it can be beneficial to have a few leaders if the structure is centralized, but surprisingly it can also be detrimental if the population is homogeneous. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation of the “babble” hypothesis which stresses the importance of talkativeness and extraversion of leaders. Further directions involve a full characterization of the main mechanisms leading to polarization or fragmentation as final states in more complex network structures, such as modular structures with nested hierarchies.",,Social and behavioural science,4,Cedric Perret,"Biology, Computer Science",Life sciences;Computing,"I am a French guy doing my 2nd year of PhD on the evolutionary origins of social organization.

The Effect of Leverage on Financial Markets,"When people get excited about their prospects on the stock market, they 
borrow money from the bank to invest. This leverage effectively couples 
the bank to the stock market. Thus, interest rates determine demand for 
stock, and demand for stock can determine interest rates. Does this 
interplay cause traders to naturally find a stable balance of leverage 
and aggressiveness? How do the behavioral traits of traders influence 
the stability of these interactions? Are there regulatory behaviors, 
such as limiting leverage or slowing margin calls, that would contribute
 to the overall health of the market?  We present an economy consisting 
of a banking sector and an equity market, with traders transferring 
money between the two.  Using an agent-based model, we will be able to 
examine how leverage couples the bank to the equities market.  
Furthermore, we can explore how different leverage strategies effects 
the stability of these markets.

Human Mobility in an Online World,"Massive multiplayer online games provide a fascinating new way of 
observing hundreds of thousands of simultaneously interacting 
individuals engaged in virtual socio-economic activities. We have 
compiled a data set consisting of practically all actions of all players
 over a period of three years from an online game played by over 350,000
 people. The universe of this online world is a network on which players
 move to interact with other players. This interaction may consist of 
trade, armed conflict, friendship and enmity. We focus on the mobility 
of human players on the network over a time-period of 500 days. We take a
 number of mobility measurements (daily and biweekly position changes, 
entropy, number of unique nodes visited) of players and compare them 
with measures of simulated random walkers on the same topology. Player 
mobility is highly different from the mobility of unbiased random 
walkers. The analysis of biased random walkers reveals the two essential
 ingredients which explain measured human mobility patterns most 
accurately: heterogeneity and a tendency to return to recently visited 
locations. We compare our entropy distributions with human mobility in 
real life world -- measured via mobile phone data -- and find a striking
 match.
","Social Science,",Social and behavioural science,4,Giovanni Petri,"Engineering, Mathematics",Engineering and engineering trades;Mathematics and statistics,"Hello there, 
formalities first: I am Giovanni Petri, PhD student at the Centre for Transport Studies and the Complexity and Networks group at Imperial College London, my advisors being Prof. J. W. Polak on the engineering side and Prof. H. J. Jensen on the math one. 
You can drop me a Terry Pratchett quote at  gpetri@imperial.ac.uk or click here for the ugly site, or  here for my (slightly better) homepage;
 my  battle with wordpress  for graphic supremacy is ongoing: the site 
is in the making and soonish there might be something resembling a list 
of projects. 
Chit chat now: 
I've always been fascinated by shapes, pattern and regularities, 
belonging to math, the real world or even just ways of thinking. So I 
ended up studying physics to (try and) make sense of all that. I 
completed my MSc in Theoretical Physics with a  thesis about primordial 
structure formation during Inflation, basically the Universe's wrinkles.
 As I was going through it turned out that what thrilled me had a lot in
 common with many issues in complex systems, statistical mechanics and 
the such. 
Making a long story short, I am working on the interfacing of 
information and transportation networks. It looks a long way to go from 
cosmology but -in truth- it’s not. The goal of identifying and 
characterizing extremely non-trivial and involved spatio-temporal 
patterns in a changing space from simple rules can be applied to both 
fields equally well.
Consider, for instance, a model of a traffic network, where cars 
circulate, coupled to an information network, where information 
diffuses. The population on a node influences the        informational state of
 the corresponding node in the information layer. The latter modifies 
the rules by which the cars go around.
What is happening is that you have a bunch of particles changing the 
landscape they are moving in, while the landscape defines where they are
 going to move next. Beyond the technicalities, the picture is not very 
different from early universe particles moving around according to a 
metric, that they contribute to modify as they move.
And if you find some self-organization, then that becomes VERY exciting!
  
Going back to the mundane, I live of short, very strong 
obsessions and these over the years encompassed basketball, tennis, 
squash, football, guitar (still trying, still failing), reading (lots!),
 trekking, video games (Eve Online for the converts), parkour and 
Capoeira. 
The last one, having lasted for quite a while now, is the exception that
 confirms the rule. Also, since there are so many climbers I wouldn't 
mind getting a crash course. No, wait, bad phrasing...
With languages I am slightly better than the average Italian, 
meaning that I can communicate in English, snore in French, had some 
pretty unsettling ""lost in translation"" experiences in German and sing

Human Path Finding in a Semantic Word Game,"Human decision-making processes are inevitably influenced by mental images, which are triggered by cues such as objects,
concepts, and words. The cognitive associations between words can be captured and represented as a semantic network,
in which words represent nodes and association between words are edges. How efficiently can humans traverse this word
association network to a given target word if, at each moment, they can only make choices about the next word they will visit?
Using participant traversal data from the appropriately designed semantic game MindPaths, we show that human players
do not rely on guessing, but navigate this association network quite efficiently, finding a specified target word often in the
minimal number of steps. We construct models to capture human paths within the MindPaths game. We find that similarity in
overall game length is easy to achieve with a trained random walker. We then consider a model of individual choices using
Bayesian estimation of transition probabilities conditional on local network connectivity. We find that it is difficult to capture the
individual decisions or the decision making process of human players. More complex models driven by semantic similarities
and other types of relations between words are necessary to fully understand how individuals choose a particular path within
this semantic word game.",,Social and behavioural science,3,Mika Straka,Physics,Physical sciences,"I am a German PhD student working in Lucca, Italy. I am a theoretical physicist and have focused my studies on statistical and dynamic systems. After my master’s thesis, which dealt with one-dimensional systems of interacting particles, I have decided to scale up to higher dimensions and to concentrate on complex networks.

One is the development of economic, political, and environmental games as critical research methods that promote players to reflect on their decisions and the development of norms, institutions, and sustainability. Key aspects in the development of these games have included offering alternatives to standard game theorietic assumptions of player rationality and finding ways to balance player motivations in ways that are neither purely cooperative nor purely competitive, leaving players with situations that feel less contrived and more like real life than most games. These games are systemic in nature, and players' choices have consequential effects on the system.

Using Habermas' theory of knowledge to understanding validity, bias, and reliability in research practice, this work suggests alternatives to positivist and post-positivist conceptions are, when dealing with normative issues, both desirable and necessary. This builds on Habermas' assertion that inquiry into positivist assumptions is not possible in positivist research since positivist research avoids inquiry into the interest laden domains that motivate positivist scholars.

Flocking in iterated reasoning,,Psychology,Social and behavioural science,3,Seth Frey,Cognitive Science and Informatics,Social and behavioural science,"Narrowly (dissertation-wise), I'm pushing the experimental side of complex dynamics in game theory. Researchers at SFi suspect that complexity is ubiquitous is complex systems. Economists argue that a newish mechanisms, what-you-think-I-think-you-think, can damp complexity in the real world. My work shows complex dynamics that are driven by this sophisticated reasoning, not prevented by it.

Broadly, I want to be able to look at a problem and tell you the organization that will solve it best, decentralized or centralized, distributed or not, coherent or incoherent.


What sort of expertise can you bring to the group?

I've spent most of the past decade killing my heroes---thinking critically about exciting ideas in complex systems. I apply complex systems concepts to social systems using experiments in human collective behavior.
My background is in cognitive science. Undergrad was cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience, with a special affection for cognitive linguistics. Grad has been about group and collective behavior: experiments and modeling.
I worked two years for Yaneer Bar-Yam at the New England Complex Systems Institute in Cambridge, MA
I have lots of side projects: I'm publishing in the strange new field applying empirical methods to the study of classic literature, like Shakespeare
I have lots of side projects: I've dabbled with RBN's, network dynamics, and community structure
I have lots of side projects: I have a project on reciprocity in the NBA

I am a 3rd year Italian PhD student at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, in Leuven, Belgium. 
I also belong to Leuven's Interuniversity MicroElectronic Center (IMEC).
My field of research is mesoscopic self-assembly. Specifically, I am 
developing new techniques to improve the packaging and assembly of 
microchip. This (rather dull) task starts to appear exciting once you 
introduce stochastic techniques and self-assembling processes to work it
 out. It seems weird, and even weirder when it works!
Anyway, this was only the n-th trail that lead me to the galaxy of complex systems. This might well be something one wants to report to a psycotherapist.
I started getting interested in complexity by the end of my 
high-school years. At that time, to show my embarassing modesty, I 
wanted to write an interdisciplinary thesis on complexity. Unluckily, 
the boundaries of my books where to narrow to contain my notes (I guess 
someone said this already a few centuries ago), so I decided to change 
topic - I switched to ""space and time"", not sure I simplified my task. 
Anyhow, since then I started pursuing a (mostly self-taught) 
educational path through self-organization, dynamical systems, pattern 
formation, critical phenomena, evolutionary computation, artificial 
intelligence. For my BS thesis, I looked into phase-looked loops, whose 
functionality is built on non-linear dynamics. For my MS thesis, I 
investigated (microelectromechanical) resonators, acquiring a taste for 
these fundamental and ubiquitous objects. Meanwhile, I was feeding on 
books by Kosko, Kauffman, Gell-Mann, Deutsch, Penrose, Barabasi, 
Strogatz, Axelrod and more. I can candidly confess I am still addicted. 
Abusing of crack might be much cheaper.
Finally, I lately realized I probably want (a subset of) this 
stuff to be the leading theme of my future career. So I thought CSSS 
might be the right place to start this private phase transition.
My other interests include playing and composing music, singing in polyphonic choirs, reading, running and write satire and short essays (Italian only, so far).

Hops across cultural boundaries: a regional analysis of beer recipe ingredients and their pairing principles,"Brewing beer has come to be regarded as a form of art, yet the consumption of beer is a cultural-specific phenomenon that evolves regionally. In the United States, for example, commercially available beers have drastically increased in number and style over the course of the last 30 years. Here we quantify diversity in beer brewing within and across different regions of the globe using a data-driven approach. The Jaccard index is used to measure actual and functional diversity of regional beer recipe ingredients and the flavor compounds they contain. We identified highly prevalent ingredients, and found them to reflect many common vintage beer recipe ingredients. We also identified regionally authentic ingredients, and found that the cultural traditions of the region are represented within those ingredients. Overall, hops offered the most regional authenticity to the recipes. Aroma preferences for hops from Europe and North America are outlined, along with regional tendencies to share flavor molecules in beer recipe ingredients.",,Social and behavioural science,3,Doheum Park,Culture Technology,Humanities,"I am currently a PhD candidate student at Graduate School of Culture Technology in KAIST.

Talking Loud Or Talking Often: How the Interplay Between Network Structure and Agent Influence Affects the Time to Reach Consensus in Collective Decision-Making,"Consensus-seeking processes are core mechanisms for social organization in non-human animal groups, human societies, artificial and multi-agent systems. Such processes consist of a series of negotiations between individuals, which ultimately aggregate different individual opinions into one common agreed decision. Related works have shown that a small number of influential and highly centralized agents i.e. leaders, considerably speed up the consensus-seeking process. Yet the important features of hierarchy and leaders have not been clearly identified and their investigation in experiments provide contradictory evidence. To disentangle these effects, we separate two features of hierarchy (i) the level of centralization ν and (ii) the number of leaders NL, i.e. influential individuals. We therefore developed a continuous opinion formation model to explore the effect of each feature and their interplay on the time to reach a global consensus. The results show that the most important feature is the topology of the network structure, with higher centralization always decreasing the time to reach consensus. In addition, it also demonstrates that the effect of influential individuals are deeply entangled with the underlying network structure. Indeed, it can be beneficial to have a few leaders if the structure is centralized, but surprisingly it can also be detrimental if the population is homogeneous. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation of the “babble” hypothesis which stresses the importance of talkativeness and extraversion of leaders. Further directions involve a full characterization of the main mechanisms leading to polarization or fragmentation as final states in more complex network structures, such as modular structures with nested hierarchies.",,Social and behavioural science,4,Guillaume St-Onge,"Physics, Network Science",Physical sciences;Computing,"PhD candidate in Physics and Network Science at Laval University in Quebec, Canada.

observing hundreds of thousands of simultaneously interacting

compiled a data set consisting of practically all actions of all players

 move to interact with other players. This interaction may consist of 
trade, armed conflict, friendship and enmity. We focus on the mobility 
of human players on the network over a time-period of 500 days. We take a
 number of mobility measurements (daily and biweekly position changes, 
entropy, number of unique nodes visited) of players and compare them 
with measures of simulated random walkers on the same topology. Player 
mobility is highly different from the mobility of unbiased random 
walkers. The analysis of biased random walkers reveals the two essential
 ingredients which explain measured human mobility patterns most 
accurately: heterogeneity and a tendency to return to recently visited 
locations. We compare our entropy distributions with human mobility in 
real life world -- measured via mobile phone data -- and find a striking
 match.

Human Mobility in an Online World,"Massive multiplayer online games provide a fascinating new way of 
observing hundreds of thousands of simultaneously interacting 
individuals engaged in virtual socio-economic activities. We have 
compiled a data set consisting of practically all actions of all players
 over a period of three years from an online game played by over 350,000
 people. The universe of this online world is a network on which players
 move to interact with other players. This interaction may consist of 
trade, armed conflict, friendship and enmity. We focus on the mobility 
of human players on the network over a time-period of 500 days. We take a
 number of mobility measurements (daily and biweekly position changes, 
entropy, number of unique nodes visited) of players and compare them 
with measures of simulated random walkers on the same topology. Player 
mobility is highly different from the mobility of unbiased random 
walkers. The analysis of biased random walkers reveals the two essential
 ingredients which explain measured human mobility patterns most 
accurately: heterogeneity and a tendency to return to recently visited 
locations. We compare our entropy distributions with human mobility in

 match.

Talking Loud Or Talking Often: How the Interplay Between Network Structure and Agent Influence Affects the Time to Reach Consensus in Collective Decision-Making,"Consensus-seeking processes are core mechanisms for social organization in non-human animal groups, human societies, artificial and multi-agent systems. Such processes consist of a series of negotiations between individuals, which ultimately aggregate different individual opinions into one common agreed decision. Related works have shown that a small number of influential and highly centralized agents i.e. leaders, considerably speed up the consensus-seeking process. Yet the important features of hierarchy and leaders have not been clearly identified and their investigation in experiments provide contradictory evidence. To disentangle these effects, we separate two features of hierarchy (i) the level of centralization ν and (ii) the number of leaders NL, i.e. influential individuals. We therefore developed a continuous opinion formation model to explore the effect of each feature and their interplay on the time to reach a global consensus. The results show that the most important feature is the topology of the network structure, with higher centralization always decreasing the time to reach consensus. In addition, it also demonstrates that the effect of influential individuals are deeply entangled with the underlying network structure. Indeed, it can be beneficial to have a few leaders if the structure is centralized, but surprisingly it can also be detrimental if the population is homogeneous. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation of the “babble” hypothesis which stresses the importance of talkativeness and extraversion of leaders. Further directions involve a full characterization of the main mechanisms leading to polarization or fragmentation as final states in more complex network structures, such as modular structures with nested hierarchies.",,Social and behavioural science,4,Andrea Santoro,Mathematics,Mathematics and statistics,"I am a second year PhD student in Applied Mathematics at the Queen Mary University of London.

The Effect of Leverage on Financial Markets,"When people get excited about their prospects on the stock market, they 
borrow money from the bank to invest. This leverage effectively couples 
the bank to the stock market. Thus, interest rates determine demand for

interplay cause traders to naturally find a stable balance of leverage 
and aggressiveness? How do the behavioral traits of traders influence 
the stability of these interactions? Are there regulatory behaviors, 
such as limiting leverage or slowing margin calls, that would contribute
 to the overall health of the market?  We present an economy consisting 
of a banking sector and an equity market, with traders transferring 
money between the two.  Using an agent-based model, we will be able to 
examine how leverage couples the bank to the equities market.  
Furthermore, we can explore how different leverage strategies effects 
the stability of these markets.

state-level society that rose and fell between approximately 500 B.C.

Krugman's work on economic geography; in particular, the model allows to
 explore the hypothesis that the complex interplay between increasing

The Coevolution of Residential and Friendship Networks: An Extension of the Schelling Model,"During the past few decades social network analysis has produced a great
 deal of insight into the workings of social systems. While social 
scientists have put a lot of work into the investigation of residential,
 friendship, trust, exchange or discussion networks, scientific inquiry 
has typically limited itself to investigating the characteristics of 
networks of only one kind. This approach has produced plentiful insight 
on the structure and function of different kinds of social networks, but
 the interaction between the different kinds of social networks has 
received insufficient investigation so far. Our work, in which we 
examine the interaction of residential and social networks represents an
 attempt at advancing this field of inquiry. More specifically, we 
extend a classic model of residential segregation (Schelling, 1968) by 
incorporating a social network that constructs -- and is influenced by 
-- residential preferences. We use Agent-Based Modelling to examine how 
social network topology affects residential segregation in the Schelling
 model. Given its current popularity in social simulation, extending the
 Schelling model is an important task in its own right, but we seek to 
achieve something more fundamental than a mere rehashing of an old 
model. We deploy Schelling's model as the basis for a way to understand 
multiplex networks, and seek to give a formal, methodologically 
practicable expression to Granovetter's concept of embeddedness.

We Got the Skills to Pay the Bills - Exploring the Link Between Occupation Diversity and Innovation,,Economics,Social and behavioural science,4,Gareth Haslam,Physics,Physical sciences,"I finished my PhD last June which was focused on developing new electrocatalysts for use in hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCV). FCV are one possible technology that could be very useful in tackling CO2 emissions and air pollution in the transport sector as they convert hydrogen fuel to electricity directly rather than combusting fossil fuels, emitting only water. Whilst they have a number of challenges to overcome, I was looking at how to replace the expensive platinum electrocatalyst which is currently an essential component. This work was carried out at the Dept. of Materials Science at the University of Cambridge, UK. I have previously received a BSc Physics from the University of Durham, UK, and an MPhil in Engineering for Sustainable Development, also at the University of Cambridge. Whilst my background is more experimentally-based, I am keen to learn more about how complexity approaches may be used in materials discovery, at the micro-level, and in promoting technology innovation and alternative energy systems, at the macro-level.

After finishing my PhD, I spent two months at the University of Tokyo at the Dept. of Complexity Science, with the 2011 JSPS Summer Program (known as EAPSI in the US).

Talking Loud Or Talking Often: How the Interplay Between Network Structure and Agent Influence Affects the Time to Reach Consensus in Collective Decision-Making,"Consensus-seeking processes are core mechanisms for social organization in non-human animal groups, human societies, artificial and multi-agent systems. Such processes consist of a series of negotiations between individuals, which ultimately aggregate different individual opinions into one common agreed decision. Related works have shown that a small number of influential and highly centralized agents i.e. leaders, considerably speed up the consensus-seeking process. Yet the important features of hierarchy and leaders have not been clearly identified and their investigation in experiments provide contradictory evidence. To disentangle these effects, we separate two features of hierarchy (i) the level of centralization ν and (ii) the number of leaders NL, i.e. influential individuals. We therefore developed a continuous opinion formation model to explore the effect of each feature and their interplay on the time to reach a global consensus. The results show that the most important feature is the topology of the network structure, with higher centralization always decreasing the time to reach consensus. In addition, it also demonstrates that the effect of influential individuals are deeply entangled with the underlying network structure. Indeed, it can be beneficial to have a few leaders if the structure is centralized, but surprisingly it can also be detrimental if the population is homogeneous. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation of the “babble” hypothesis which stresses the importance of talkativeness and extraversion of leaders. Further directions involve a full characterization of the main mechanisms leading to polarization or fragmentation as final states in more complex network structures, such as modular structures with nested hierarchies.",,Social and behavioural science,4,Zohar Neu,Mathematics,Mathematics and statistics,Zohar is a PhD student at the University of Bristol.

Human Path Finding in a Semantic Word Game,"Human decision-making processes are inevitably influenced by mental images, which are triggered by cues such as objects,
concepts, and words. The cognitive associations between words can be captured and represented as a semantic network,
in which words represent nodes and association between words are edges. How efficiently can humans traverse this word
association network to a given target word if, at each moment, they can only make choices about the next word they will visit?
Using participant traversal data from the appropriately designed semantic game MindPaths, we show that human players
do not rely on guessing, but navigate this association network quite efficiently, finding a specified target word often in the
minimal number of steps. We construct models to capture human paths within the MindPaths game. We find that similarity in
overall game length is easy to achieve with a trained random walker. We then consider a model of individual choices using
Bayesian estimation of transition probabilities conditional on local network connectivity. We find that it is difficult to capture the
individual decisions or the decision making process of human players. More complex models driven by semantic similarities
and other types of relations between words are necessary to fully understand how individuals choose a particular path within
this semantic word game.",,Social and behavioural science,3,Nicole Beckage,"Computer Science, Cognitive Science",Computing,Nicole Beckage is a PhD student in Computer Science and Cognitive Science at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Hops across cultural boundaries: a regional analysis of beer recipe ingredients and their pairing principles,"Brewing beer has come to be regarded as a form of art, yet the consumption of beer is a cultural-specific phenomenon that evolves regionally.

Here we quantify diversity in beer brewing within and across different regions of the globe using a data-driven approach. The Jaccard index is used to measure actual and functional diversity of regional beer recipe ingredients and the flavor compounds they contain. We identified highly prevalent ingredients, and found them to reflect many common vintage beer recipe ingredients. We also identified regionally authentic ingredients, and found that the cultural traditions of the region are represented within those ingredients.

The Effect of Leverage on Financial Markets,"When people get excited about their prospects on the stock market, they 
borrow money from the bank to invest. This leverage effectively couples 
the bank to the stock market. Thus, interest rates determine demand for 
stock, and demand for stock can determine interest rates. Does this 
interplay cause traders to naturally find a stable balance of leverage 
and aggressiveness? How do the behavioral traits of traders influence 
the stability of these interactions? Are there regulatory behaviors, 
such as limiting leverage or slowing margin calls, that would contribute
 to the overall health of the market?  We present an economy consisting 
of a banking sector and an equity market, with traders transferring 
money between the two.  Using an agent-based model, we will be able to 
examine how leverage couples the bank to the equities market.  
Furthermore, we can explore how different leverage strategies effects 
the stability of these markets.

mobility is highly different from the mobility of unbiased random 
walkers. The analysis of biased random walkers reveals the two essential
 ingredients which explain measured human mobility patterns most 
accurately: heterogeneity and a tendency to return to recently visited 
locations. We compare our entropy distributions with human mobility in

 match.

The dynamics of norms under reinforcement learning,,Psychology,Social and behavioural science,4,Alireza Goudarzi,Computer Science,Computing,"I am a second year PhD computer science student in the University of New Mexico. My broad research area is computation and learning in dynamical systems with application to computation using biomolecular systems and self-assembled nanoscale networks. Align with my broad research area, I am interested in machine learning, data mining, dynamical system theory, artificial intelligence, computational learning theory, physics of disordered systems, complex networks and related fields.

Currently, my focus is on reservoir computing, which is a new paradigm in neural networks and has shown great performance in non-linear and chaotic signal processing. In contrast to traditional neural networks, in which the system is fine tuned using a learning algorithm to solve a particular task, in reservoir computing a recurrent neural network is initialized and fixed with no further fine tuning. The signal is given to the network and a linear readout layer performs a linear combination of the states to produce the target output. The weights of the linear combination is calculated using linear regression which can be performed in closed form efficiently. My goal is to understand this paradigm better and study what kinds of problems they can and they cannot solve and how the paradigm can be applied to unconventional computing substrates such as nanoscale self-assembled electronics or DNA molecules.

My most recent work on reservoir computing is the direct estimation of error in task solving based on the structure of the dynamical system and statics of the input and output. The approach is currently limited to linear systems but I'm hoping to extend it to nonlinear systems and systems with finite dynamic range. I would be happy to talk about this more to other summer school students and even collaborate on taking it further.",,Male,Student,University of New Mexico,United States,301-400,2014,Santa Fe,Kyle,

An Individualist Theory of Collective Knowledge Creation,,,Social and behavioural science,3,Anna Zaytseva,Information Systems,Computing,"I am doing my PhD in Information Systems at the University of Oslo in Norway (3rd year), and soon I am going to get my degree. I apply the approach of Complex Adaptive Systems to generate a stepwise method to study mutual shaping between technologies and law, so the space in between those two – at the edge – is in focus. That space is a CAS with memory. I have two case studies of radically different e-health technologies of Norway, and each case has an own CAS. A CAS initially consists of about a hundred to almost a thousand smallest elements depending on the scale of a case. The elements are legal as norms & values, technologic as technical & conceptual, and social in situ & ex situ for the design work. Having appeared once, the elements of each CAS re-appear in time and increase in quantity to several thousand, what makes the memories be path-dependent and highly interconnected inside. Although the research is completely qualitative, manual and bottom-up, it provides a non-linear analysis of the phenomenon of mutual shaping between technologies and law with large visual representations at each subsequent step conducted in accordance with rules, which I have generated from one case study and replicated in another. In my method, I trace causalities in the CAS(s) and test a hypothesis whether attractors in the legal environment are shared among the design works on those technologies. Three attractors from four vs. six are shared, whereas the remaining ones invite a third case study. Unique technical implications in specific shapes and their information loops with the legal environment are indicated and the reasons explained. The research provides a transdisciplinary path for studying the complexity between law and technologies and calls specialists in the local fields – law, design studies and organization science – to examine the findings in detail by use of their own discipline methodologies.

My own initial background is in law, which I got at the National Research University – Higher School of Economics in Russia, and I wrote my Master’s thesis on policy analysis of standardization in six innovation markets of the European Union, what I did at Linköping University in Sweden. Besides, I have work experience both in public and private organizations. I am very interested in technologies and their architectures, as well as approaches to anticipate future. I have my own home library in Complexity Science that I consider to be advanced transdisciplinary methodology in harmony with nature. Therefore, at CSSS 2015 I am particularly interested to learn more about emerging transdisciplinary approaches for data analysis, where meanings behind words play crucial role.

We Got the Skills to Pay the Bills - Exploring the Link Between Occupation Diversity and Innovation,,Economics,Social and behavioural science,4,Nicolas Goudemand,Paleontology,Physical sciences,"Hi everyone, I'm Nick, a physicist turned paleontologist. I'm currently a postdoc fellow at the Paleontological Institute and Museum of the Univ. of Zurich, Switzerland (PIMUZ).

My main interest is in the coupled histories of Earth and life on various spatial and time scales. My recent research experience includes the integrative use of paleontological, geochemical and sedimentological data in order to study the mechanisms that led to the greatest mass extinction of the Phanerozoic at the Permo-Triassic boundary (about 250 Ma).

During my PhD in paleontology I became an expert on conodonts, which were eel-shaped, marine animals. Their tooth-like phosphatic elements represent the earliest expression of a mineralized skeleton among vertebrates. These conodont elements are important index fossils from the Cambrian to the end of the Triassic. As such, not only they provide an interesting tool for evolutionary studies, but they also enable to construct timescales against which geological and biological events can be calibrated. Moreover, their chemical composition has remained relatively stable and hence they record past changes in the temperature and composition of oceans.

Some of my last results include a 3d reconstruction of their oro-pharyngeal apparatus at work (movie). In the near future I plan to use functional analysis of these ‘teeth’ to infer the potential location of different conodont taxa within past food webs and to study changes of these food webs’ topology in relation with evolutionary events (innovations, radiations, crisis). Because the morphology of these ‘teeth’ obviously do not reflect only functional purposes but also important developmental aspects (which are potentially common to extant vertebrates), another project that I’m currently preparing deals with the morphogenesis of these tooth-like elements.

During the last years I have devoted most of my efforts to the production and analysis of empirical data. In the near future I plan to focus on the development of data-driven theoretical models. In most of these projects, I have to deal with complex systems. Though my training as a physicist included some of the required tools, I feel that I might need an update on some of the topics addressed during the CSSS. My main motivation for attending (and actively participating in ;) ) the CSSS is to have the chance to meet the experts on these topics and hence get a current overview over potentials and limitations of complex systems research.

"Innovation, Sustainability and Growth of Human Social Organizations from Cities to Corporations","The intent of this research is to build on the successful body of work that has already begun
at SFI on developing a broad fundamental, quantitative, predictive theory of social
organizations. A major component is to understand the role of innovation and adaptability in
shaping the growth and sustainability of cities to corporations. Such a theoretical framework
is potentially very powerful for a company like Boeing in helping to recognize and understand
that its growth, evolution and development have been constrained by general ""laws"" which
may have important implications for its long-term survivability. Such laws reflect the
general dynamical and structural properties of the multiple underlying networks of the
organization itself as well as its relationship with the broader business community. This is
manifested in generic scaling laws that indicate that organizations that participate in a
business/economic ecology did not evolve, grow and adapt either ""randomly"" or in a planned
controlled manner but were subject to dynamical laws. From a research perspective we
view Boeing as a ""case study"" by providing data and significant support for the research.
The project will be focused on understanding these big questions by seeking to reveal the
underlying principles, constraints and dynamics independent of the details by which
companies grow and evolve driven by innovation (their ""coarse-grained behavior"").

Dynamics of Shared Mental Representation: What can a simple network of agents tell us?,"This paper develops a simple model of how individuals automatically and 
unconsciously use social information feedbacks from other individuals in
 order to determine the mental representation they will impose upon a 
social situation. An agent-based modelling approach is used to 
demonstrate how these learning processes, when carried out in an 
inter-subjective context, are sufficient to generate a number of 
dynamics that characterize real social systems. Results indicate that 
both network structure and updating strategies significantly determine 
the pattern of mental representation adoption across the set of agents. 
Significant findings include the non-trivialness of reaching full 
consensus in a group, the emergence of distinct sub-groups and cultural 
“brokers” between them, and the variable ability of a single agent 
acting independently of social feedbacks to drive the entire system 
toward consensus.

Modeling and simulating the emergence of Internet communities: impact of the spread of memes and agent memory,"The spreading of memes on the web played an important role in the emergence of Internet communities. The principal purpose of the study is to implement a simulation model to analyze the process of emergence of Internet communities. The model shows the importance of factors such as the interactions between online agents as well as their propensity to adopt and remember new memes. In addition, it explores the threshold between isolated cultural short-lived trends and the viral spreading of many cultural features. The simulation model is an agent-based model built using NetLogoTM software, designed such that agents represent Internet users and memes are represented by features appearing randomly on each agent. The model illustrates the spread across the whole network as shown through interactions of agents indicating further, that the structure of the network, especially the number of indegree and outdegree links between agents, has a crucial influence on how many memes are shared among agents in the long run. In other words, a greater connectivity leads to the quick sharing and sustainability of several cultural features, which is the basis for the emergence of a community.",,Social and behavioural science;Computing,4,Aida Huerta Barrientos,Operations,Engineering and engineering trades,"Dr. Aida Huerta Barrientos is an academic-researcher the Department of Operations Research, Faculty of Engineering, UNAM, focusing on modeling and simulation of complex adaptive systems to analyze their emergent patterns, explain and predict their viable dynamics, and determine their fitness landscape.

Research interests
My research interests aim at integrating dynamical and complex systems’ views in psychology (epistemology-wise as well as in clinical practice). I particularly focus on fractals and their relation to psychoanalysis and psychic phenomena in clinical settings, but also taking into account neuroscience, sociology, linguistics and behavior. Outside of traditional human sciences, I have focused on fractals, attractors, self-similarity, nodes, dissipative systems, phase transitions and feedback loops. This multidisciplinary approach sheds light on clinical treatment, repetition, symptoms, projection, bodily manifestations and psychopathological structures such as autism, psychosis, neurosis and their relation to the culture they are engrained in.

Current Research
I am currently doing my PH.D. at the Center for Research in Psychoanalysis, Medicine and Society at the University of Paris 7, Sorbonne-Cité, Denis-Diderot. My focus is on Fractals and the Psyche; repetition, structure and self-similarity. This research contributes to clinical, as well as epistemological aspects in the field of psychology. Fractals seem to be a key to understanding repetitive symptoms and maladaptive response systems, crucial factors for the efficiency of therapy. On the other hand, I strive to integrate recent developments of complex systems, chaos theory, and specifically fractal geometry in my field. Some efforts to explore this multidisciplinary junction have already been explored around the world with promising results, but it seems we have just seen the tip of the iceberg in a field where there is still much to do.

I find much pleasure in exploring and sharing ideas about subjects such as adaptive networks, evolutionary theory, diseases (transmissible or not), human evolution and behavior, among others. This summer school, I excitedly suspect, will be a wonderful environment to engage in fruitful discussions of this kind.

I am originally from Cuba, where I did my undergraduate studies in Physics. Still passionate about Physics in general, I decided to switch gears and look into Applied Mathematics. I am in the second year of my Ph.D. at Arizona State University.

Project Interests
My research is basically related to mathematical epidemiology. More specifically, I am currently interested in the interplay between the evolution of transmissible diseases and population's contact structures. That is, how disease traits, such as virulence, evolve in response to the topological properties of the social network, and how, in turn, the disease dynamics influences the adaptive behaviors of the agents/nodes in the network and hence its topology. This, in a sense, is a broad research question, thus it can be framed or contextualized in many ways; ways that I am more than happy to talk about, explore and expand during my time at this CSSS. Finding answers to questions of this kind could be relevant to major public health issues such as the evolution of microbial drug resistance, the emergence of new diseases and vaccine designs.

I am currently working on a joint PhD in Economics and JD (law 
degree) at George Mason University in Arlington, VA.  My areas of 
concentration in economics are public choice (an economic analysis of politics), the economics of religion (similar to the sociology of religion, but using the tools of economic analysis), and ‘law and economics’.
  After seeing many impoverished areas of the world, I have a particular
 interest in how all of these factors affect economic development in the
 developing world.  Within law, my areas of interest include 
intellectual property, technology law, and criminal law.  My current 
research involves investigating the impact of gender imbalance (more 
women than men in a population or vice-versa) and information 
availability on marriage markets.
Prior to coming to GMU to study economics and law, I was a 
controls and project engineer working in the power industry.  I have a 
degree in mechanical engineering from Virginia Tech and an MBA from the 
University of Florida.
Besides my work and studies, I love to travel.  I’ve made it to 
28 countries, 7 continents (including Antarctica), and 50 states so far.
  I enjoy kayaking (probably not too much of that in the desert), 
camping, reading, and road trips just about anywhere and everywhere.
I look forward to meeting everyone this summer.  In the meantime, you can e-mail me at hollar@mindspring.com.

Mean First Saturation Time (MFST) and its Application to Refugee Movement," In this network, nodes are cities or refugee camps, and edges denote the distance between them. We model refugees as random walkers who are biased towards the refugee camps which can hold sj people. To determine the source nodes (i) and the initial number of random walkers (n), we use data on where the conflicts happened and the number of refugees that arrive at any camp under a twomonth period after the start of the conflict. With such information, we divide the early stage of the Burundi 2015 conflict into two waves of refugees. Using the first wave of refugees we calibrate the biased parameter β of the random walk to best match the distribution of refugees on the camps. Then, we test the prediction of the distribution of refugees in camps for the second wave using the same biased parameters. Our results show that the biased random walk can capture, to some extent, the distribution of refugees in different camps (see figure 1).

I have been doing clinical work in institutions and private practice since 2007, and have also worked on the field of prevention, doing harm reduction talks and workshops, as well as statistics. I have spoken publicly (radio and television, public gatherings and seminars) and have presented scientific communications on my research around the world (so far in France, Australia and Mexico).

Research interests
My research interests aim at integrating dynamical and complex systems’ views in psychology (epistemology-wise as well as in clinical practice). I particularly focus on fractals and their relation to psychoanalysis and psychic phenomena in clinical settings, but also taking into account neuroscience, sociology, linguistics and behavior. Outside of traditional human sciences, I have focused on fractals, attractors, self-similarity, nodes, dissipative systems, phase transitions and feedback loops. This multidisciplinary approach sheds light on clinical treatment, repetition, symptoms, projection, bodily manifestations and psychopathological structures such as autism, psychosis, neurosis and their relation to the culture they are engrained in.

Current Research
I am currently doing my PH.D. at the Center for Research in Psychoanalysis, Medicine and Society at the University of Paris 7, Sorbonne-Cité, Denis-Diderot. My focus is on Fractals and the Psyche; repetition, structure and self-similarity. This research contributes to clinical, as well as epistemological aspects in the field of psychology. Fractals seem to be a key to understanding repetitive symptoms and maladaptive response systems, crucial factors for the efficiency of therapy. On the other hand, I strive to integrate recent developments of complex systems, chaos theory, and specifically fractal geometry in my field. Some efforts to explore this multidisciplinary junction have already been explored around the world with promising results, but it seems we have just seen the tip of the iceberg in a field where there is still much to do.

Ecological modeling of arrow bamboo,"Using two models (analysis of altitude-abundance patterns and an agent-based model) we demonstrate that global warming is a possible explanation of the declines of arrow bamboos in Mount Shennongjia, west-central China. Under two different scenarios (Temperature increments 1.5° C and 6 °C) both models predict upward shifts of bamboo populations. For the first scenario, the agent-based model also predicts serious reductions of the population of bamboo. For the second scenario the first model predicts serious declines (>%50) whereas extinction of the bamboo are predicted under the second model. Differences between the predicted bamboo populations and the models are due to the agent-based model’s inclusion of bamboo life history traits and competition with other plant species. It is important to monitor the dynamics of arrow bamboo because it is clear that this species is very susceptible to global warming and also because many species of animals subsist entirely on a diet of bamboo and reduction or extinction of this species could lead to extinction of these animals.",,Social and behavioural science,5,Wei Yang,Epidemiology,Health,"I'm a PhD student in genetic epidemiolgoy at Cardiovascular Institute & Fu Wai Hospital, Beijing.

Opinion spreading and consensus formation on complex networks,"We study a model of opinion spreading and consensus formation in a population on complex networks. Given a static network structure, the individuals can diffuse on it when two neighboring individuals’ opinions are beyond the “bounded confidence” ε. This is the case that arises in political situations while the opinions of voters can be adapted promptly after communication. The model is governed by the following two rules. At each time step, each individual can exchange their opinions with their neighbors if the difference of their opinions is smaller than ε; otherwise, one can move to an vacancy location if permitted. The distribution of opinions over the population evolves towards either a consensus that all individuals share the same opinion or polarization and fragmentation state. The statistical properties of this final state vary considerably as the model parameters change. It is shown that, when the dispersal abilities of the individuals are considered, the bounded confidence which is required to attain consensus can be remarkably decrease.",,Social and behavioural science,3,Liu Jianguo,Engineering,Engineering and engineering trades,"Hello, everyone.

Human Navigational Heuristics in Solving the Euclidean Travelling Salesman Problem,"Humans outperform, within limits, most algorithmic solutions in spatial optimization tasks, such as in the Euclidean Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). It has been recently suggested that people follow simple, perceptual heuristics – like preferring closed shapes or following the boundaries – rather than applying computationally expensive algorithms. In the present paper, human navigational heuristics were simulated in standard 10-nodes TSPs with different levels of difficulty. Within an agent-based model, an artificial travelling agent evaluates a disutility function at each step with respect to the distance to potential object, memory of previous routes taken, and the distance from home. The number of steps in each tour was recorded and solutions were analyzed. We conclude that human navigational heuristics can lead to near-optimal solutions in tasks like the TSP, and that solutions modelled herein are both cognitively feasible and efficiently robust to a variety of circumstance.

An Agent Based Model of Crisis-Driven Migration,"The literature on ethnic migration suggests that natural disasters, armed conflict, economics and cultural networks are key drivers of migration. The dearth of geo- referenced ethnic data, however, limits the value of econometric analysis. We build an agent-based model to simulate crisis-driven migration. Agents within a multi-ethnic population monitor their spatial environments to formulate perceptions of the risk of being persecuted. The expected utility of staying within a given neighborhood is inversely related to the perceived probability of persecution. Cultural networks temper an agent's security calculus, with strong social ties dampening the human security dilemma. Agents express preferences regarding the different ethnic groups in their spatial environment and social network. Social networks expand over time, but are often negatively impacted by exogenous social shocks. The resulting migratory patterns and ethnic clustering is a product of the confluence of event location and magnitude, ethnic tension, demographic factors and breadth of networks. Initial finding suggest that crisis- driven migration patterns are influenced by shock size and magnitude.","Sociology, Migration",Social and behavioural science,4,Michael Makowsky,Economics,Social and behavioural science,"I am currently a Ph.D. student in economics at George Mason University.

Ecological modeling of arrow bamboo,"Using two models (analysis of altitude-abundance patterns and an agent-based model) we demonstrate that global warming is a possible explanation of the declines of arrow bamboos in Mount Shennongjia, west-central China. Under two different scenarios (Temperature increments 1.5° C and 6 °C) both models predict upward shifts of bamboo populations. For the first scenario, the agent-based model also predicts serious reductions of the population of bamboo. For the second scenario the first model predicts serious declines (>%50) whereas extinction of the bamboo are predicted under the second model. Differences between the predicted bamboo populations and the models are due to the agent-based model’s inclusion of bamboo life history traits and competition with other plant species. It is important to monitor the dynamics of arrow bamboo because it is clear that this species is very susceptible to global warming and also because many species of animals subsist entirely on a diet of bamboo and reduction or extinction of this species could lead to extinction of these animals.",,Social and behavioural science,5,Xiaowu Zhu,Management Science,Business and administration,"Hello,Everyone!

Robustness Analysis of the Heat Shock Response using semiquantitative Reasoning,"The Heat Shock Response (HSR) is a universal procedure among organisms that repairs protein damage in- duced by heat and other stresses. It is a simple biological mechanism that is yet rich enough to be analyzed from the perspective of robustness and efficiency. A series of papers by El-Samad et al. [1], [2] have presented a control theoretical approach for studying HSR in Escherichia coli bacteria. They argue that the complexity of the HSR control mechanism is necessary to achieve the observed robustness of such biological systems.
We extend the control theoretical approach, applying interval analysis to Lyapunov’s indirect method, and consider the robustness of the HSR with respect to uncertainties in the individual chemical reaction rates. In order to design alternative control mechanisms for the HSR we compute the optimal control to the protein damage-repair cycle. Furthermore we propose a novel reduced order model of the HSR.",Biology,Social and behavioural science,5,Charlie Messina,"Biology, Engineering",Life sciences;Engineering and engineering trades,"I am a Research Scientist at Pioneer Hi-Bred International, a company that develops and supplies advanced plant genetics worldwide.

Games on Evolving Networks,"Thispaperexploresthecoevolutionofnetworkformationandcooperativebehaviour.Ithas previously been shown that the structure of a community (for example, as formed by social relationships) can have a substantial impact on the evolution of cooperative behaviour. We hypothesize that the nature of the game played on such a network can alter the way that individuals make and break social connections, therefore leading to a feedback loop between the network structure and the behaviour in the game. We explore the dynamics of this process in a model where individuals form connections with others based on simple genetically encoded rules, and play one of a variety of two-player games with their connections. In order to explore the effects of different payoff structures in these games, simulations over a wide range of parameter space have been pursued, producing games including the Prisoner’s Dilemma, the Stag Hunt, and Hawk-Dove. By comparing to traditional game-theoretic models, we show that allowing the network structure to evolve prevents defectors from completely taking over the population, and also broadens the circumstances under which cooperation can fix. A first analysis of the properties of the networks created in these evolving populations suggests a mechanism for these results: when defectors are common, networks are created which tend to retard the effects of selection and encourage drift, while when cooperators are common, the networks formed tend to enhance selection and drive the population more quickly to the fully cooperative outcome.","Game Theory, Computer Sciencs",Social and behavioural science,5,Adrian de Froment,Biology,Life sciences,"I am a second year PhD student in Simon Levin's lab in the department of ecology and evolutionary biology at Princeton.

An Optimization Algorithm Based on the Small-World Phenomenon,"We propose an optimization algorithm, called the small-world algorithm (SWA), based on searching mechanisms in social networks. The SWA emphasizes local rather than global search to find the solutions for optimization problems. We investigate two encoding strategies, binary encoding and decimal encoding, in the SWA and test them by function optimization and 0- 1 multidimensional knapsack problems. Simulation studies show that compared with the corresponding genetic algorithm (GA) the SWA is capable of preserving diversity in the set of candidate solutions, avoiding premature of the population, overcoming the “GA deceptive problem” and it converges faster. These properties suggest that the SWA is a useful method for solving complicated optimization problems.","Computer Science, Sociology",Social and behavioural science,3,Haifeng Du,"Computer Science, Public Health",Computing;Social and behavioural science,"I am a Postdoc. in Morrison Institute for Population and Resource Studies of Stanford University.

An Agent Based Model of Crisis-Driven Migration,"The literature on ethnic migration suggests that natural disasters, armed conflict, economics and cultural networks are key drivers of migration. The dearth of geo- referenced ethnic data, however, limits the value of econometric analysis. We build an agent-based model to simulate crisis-driven migration. Agents within a multi-ethnic population monitor their spatial environments to formulate perceptions of the risk of being persecuted. The expected utility of staying within a given neighborhood is inversely related to the perceived probability of persecution. Cultural networks temper an agent's security calculus, with strong social ties dampening the human security dilemma. Agents express preferences regarding the different ethnic groups in their spatial environment and social network. Social networks expand over time, but are often negatively impacted by exogenous social shocks. The resulting migratory patterns and ethnic clustering is a product of the confluence of event location and magnitude, ethnic tension, demographic factors and breadth of networks. Initial finding suggest that crisis- driven migration patterns are influenced by shock size and magnitude.","Sociology, Migration",Social and behavioural science,4,Patrick Meier,Law,Law,"I'm pursuing a PhD at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy based at Tufts University in Boston and my interests range from international conflict prevention and disaster early warning systems to complexity theory and network science.

Games on Evolving Networks,"Thispaperexploresthecoevolutionofnetworkformationandcooperativebehaviour.Ithas previously been shown that the structure of a community (for example, as formed by social relationships) can have a substantial impact on the evolution of cooperative behaviour. We hypothesize that the nature of the game played on such a network can alter the way that individuals make and break social connections, therefore leading to a feedback loop between the network structure and the behaviour in the game. We explore the dynamics of this process in a model where individuals form connections with others based on simple genetically encoded rules, and play one of a variety of two-player games with their connections. In order to explore the effects of different payoff structures in these games, simulations over a wide range of parameter space have been pursued, producing games including the Prisoner’s Dilemma, the Stag Hunt, and Hawk-Dove. By comparing to traditional game-theoretic models, we show that allowing the network structure to evolve prevents defectors from completely taking over the population, and also broadens the circumstances under which cooperation can fix. A first analysis of the properties of the networks created in these evolving populations suggests a mechanism for these results: when defectors are common, networks are created which tend to retard the effects of selection and encourage drift, while when cooperators are common, the networks formed tend to enhance selection and drive the population more quickly to the fully cooperative outcome.","Game Theory, Computer Sciencs",Social and behavioural science,5,Juan Calderon,,,"Doing some research on the propagation of information through social networks, where information is analogous to a virus spreading through the social network.

Cultural Evolution: A Phylogenetic Perspective,"Despite the outstanding breadth of human cultural variation, relatively little progress has been made in understanding the coordinated evolution of suites of cultural traits. Controlling for phylogenetic associations, we examine pairwise-correlations between nine cultural traits in thirty Indo-European societies.

Robustness Analysis of the Heat Shock Response using semiquantitative Reasoning,"The Heat Shock Response (HSR) is a universal procedure among organisms that repairs protein damage in- duced by heat and other stresses. It is a simple biological mechanism that is yet rich enough to be analyzed from the perspective of robustness and efficiency. A series of papers by El-Samad et al. [1], [2] have presented a control theoretical approach for studying HSR in Escherichia coli bacteria. They argue that the complexity of the HSR control mechanism is necessary to achieve the observed robustness of such biological systems.
We extend the control theoretical approach, applying interval analysis to Lyapunov’s indirect method, and consider the robustness of the HSR with respect to uncertainties in the individual chemical reaction rates. In order to design alternative control mechanisms for the HSR we compute the optimal control to the protein damage-repair cycle.

An Agent Based Model of Crisis-Driven Migration,"The literature on ethnic migration suggests that natural disasters, armed conflict, economics and cultural networks are key drivers of migration. The dearth of geo- referenced ethnic data, however, limits the value of econometric analysis. We build an agent-based model to simulate crisis-driven migration. Agents within a multi-ethnic population monitor their spatial environments to formulate perceptions of the risk of being persecuted. The expected utility of staying within a given neighborhood is inversely related to the perceived probability of persecution. Cultural networks temper an agent's security calculus, with strong social ties dampening the human security dilemma. Agents express preferences regarding the different ethnic groups in their spatial environment and social network. Social networks expand over time, but are often negatively impacted by exogenous social shocks. The resulting migratory patterns and ethnic clustering is a product of the confluence of event location and magnitude, ethnic tension, demographic factors and breadth of networks. Initial finding suggest that crisis- driven migration patterns are influenced by shock size and magnitude.","Sociology, Migration",Social and behavioural science,4,Jorge Tavares,Computer Science,Computing," Hi, my name is Jorge Tavares and I am a Computer Science PhD student, in the area of Evolutionary Computation, at the University of Coimbra.

Diversity and Cooperation,,,Social and behavioural science,5,Ryan Muldoon,Philosophy,Humanities,"I recently completed my PhD in the Philosophy department at the University of Pennsylvania. Upon returning from China, I will begin a postdoc with the University of Western Ontario's Rotman Institute of Science and Values. My work is in two main areas: social/political philosophy, and the philosophy of science. My advisor at Penn was Cristina Bicchieri.

My dissertation was in political philosophy: in particular, I developed a new account of social contract theory that focused on how social contracts should function in diverse societies. This involved developing an account of perspectives (by which I mean a scheme of categorization and a search procedure), a novel moral standpoint - ""The View from Everywhere"", a bargaining approach that allows the participants to not have to agree over what they are bargaining over, and an account of toleration. This is the beginning of a larger project on diversity in social systems.

Smaller projects that I am also working in also revolve around issues with diversity. I'm in the midst of finishing a paper that got started by my CSSS work in '06 - a model of the Schelling Segregation Dynamic in which agents who want to be in the minority end up segregated anyway. I have also begun planning a follow-up paper on this topic that will (hopefully) show that if agents pay attention to different properties, there are more stable integrated states. The thought is that if some find race salient, while others find religion important, and still others find taste in music most salient, then there will be more of a chance that the macro view of the population will be integrated.

I also have been working on social norms. A paper I'm working on completing right now looks at the conditions under which multiple norms can be a stable state of an evolutionary game. In particular, what learning rules support such a stable state, and whether network structure of the population influences the equilibrium state.

In the philosophy of science, I have methodological interests, looking at the epistemic justifications of the tools of complex systems analysis. However, I am most interested in the social structure of science, particularly how incentive systems and methods of communication shape the output of science. I've coauthored a couple papers on this subject, developing an ""epistemic landscapes"" model of scientific sub-fields. Scientist-agents act as hill climbers on an unknown landscape. What I investigate is what methods of incorporating information about the attempts of other scientists is most conducive to maximizing social output. This project has been working with a model of implicit networks, but the next model iteration, which I hope will be able to describe longer timescales, will be moving to a dynamic explicit network structure.

We analyze each network with two different metrics (i) fitness: we minimize the diameter of networks, and maximize the passenger flow for each edge; (ii) robustness: we compute the change in average path length after removing predetermined hubs and account for the scale of network disintegration. Finally, we compare the robustness of the network of different airlines and find that some small domestic airlines have very good robustness properties.

Human Navigational Heuristics in Solving the Euclidean Travelling Salesman Problem,"Humans outperform, within limits, most algorithmic solutions in spatial optimization tasks, such as in the Euclidean Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). It has been recently suggested that people follow simple, perceptual heuristics – like preferring closed shapes or following the boundaries – rather than applying computationally expensive algorithms. In the present paper, human navigational heuristics were simulated in standard 10-nodes TSPs with different levels of difficulty. Within an agent-based model, an artificial travelling agent evaluates a disutility function at each step with respect to the distance to potential object, memory of previous routes taken, and the distance from home. The number of steps in each tour was recorded and solutions were analyzed. We conclude that human navigational heuristics can lead to near-optimal solutions in tasks like the TSP, and that solutions modelled herein are both cognitively feasible and efficiently robust to a variety of circumstance.",Cognitive Science,Social and behavioural science,2,Tamas Makany,Psychology,Social and behavioural science,"Hello!

An Agent Based Model of Crisis-Driven Migration,"The literature on ethnic migration suggests that natural disasters, armed conflict, economics and cultural networks are key drivers of migration. The dearth of geo- referenced ethnic data, however, limits the value of econometric analysis. We build an agent-based model to simulate crisis-driven migration. Agents within a multi-ethnic population monitor their spatial environments to formulate perceptions of the risk of being persecuted. The expected utility of staying within a given neighborhood is inversely related to the perceived probability of persecution. Cultural networks temper an agent's security calculus, with strong social ties dampening the human security dilemma. Agents express preferences regarding the different ethnic groups in their spatial environment and social network. Social networks expand over time, but are often negatively impacted by exogenous social shocks. The resulting migratory patterns and ethnic clustering is a product of the confluence of event location and magnitude, ethnic tension, demographic factors and breadth of networks. Initial finding suggest that crisis- driven migration patterns are influenced by shock size and magnitude.","Sociology, Migration",Social and behavioural science,4,Tamas Makany,Psychology,Social and behavioural science,"Hello!

Games on Evolving Networks,"Thispaperexploresthecoevolutionofnetworkformationandcooperativebehaviour.Ithas previously been shown that the structure of a community (for example, as formed by social relationships) can have a substantial impact on the evolution of cooperative behaviour. We hypothesize that the nature of the game played on such a network can alter the way that individuals make and break social connections, therefore leading to a feedback loop between the network structure and the behaviour in the game. We explore the dynamics of this process in a model where individuals form connections with others based on simple genetically encoded rules, and play one of a variety of two-player games with their connections. In order to explore the effects of different payoff structures in these games, simulations over a wide range of parameter space have been pursued, producing games including the Prisoner’s Dilemma, the Stag Hunt, and Hawk-Dove. By comparing to traditional game-theoretic models, we show that allowing the network structure to evolve prevents defectors from completely taking over the population, and also broadens the circumstances under which cooperation can fix. A first analysis of the properties of the networks created in these evolving populations suggests a mechanism for these results: when defectors are common, networks are created which tend to retard the effects of selection and encourage drift, while when cooperators are common, the networks formed tend to enhance selection and drive the population more quickly to the fully cooperative outcome.","Game Theory, Computer Sciencs",Social and behavioural science,5,Matina Donaldson,Anthropology,Social and behavioural science,"I am a fourth-year graduate student at the University of Washington in Seattle, but am currently spending much of my time at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.

Ecological modeling of arrow bamboo,"Using two models (analysis of altitude-abundance patterns and an agent-based model) we demonstrate that global warming is a possible explanation of the declines of arrow bamboos in Mount Shennongjia, west-central China. Under two different scenarios (Temperature increments 1.5° C and 6 °C) both models predict upward shifts of bamboo populations. For the first scenario, the agent-based model also predicts serious reductions of the population of bamboo. For the second scenario the first model predicts serious declines (>%50) whereas extinction of the bamboo are predicted under the second model. Differences between the predicted bamboo populations and the models are due to the agent-based model’s inclusion of bamboo life history traits and competition with other plant species. It is important to monitor the dynamics of arrow bamboo because it is clear that this species is very susceptible to global warming and also because many species of animals subsist entirely on a diet of bamboo and reduction or extinction of this species could lead to extinction of these animals.",,Social and behavioural science,5,Tongli Zhang,,,I am Tongli Zhang from Virginia Tech (http://mpf.biol.vt.edu/). looking forward to a great summer! ,,,,Virginia Tech,United States,201-300,2006,Beijing,Fabian,

A basic challenge of water management is finding ways to cope with changing conditions and an increasingly uncertain natural disturbances regime. In research areas other than water management, diversification has been shown successful in increasing adaptive capacity, learning and innovation. However the relationship between diversity and the ability to cope with uncertain stresses has been a neglected research topic in river basin management. For long river basin management has focussed on selecting the most cost effective measure to cope with a specific quantified stress. The underlying structure of how diverse water system services and their users interact with the full range of the natural disturbances regime has been addressed rarely. The relationship of diversification and adaptive capacity remains largely unexplored.

The objective of my research is to evaluate how diversification of water system services and their use can support adaptive capacity in managed river basins at different scales in time and space.

One of the questions I would like to explore with you is the possibility of a consequential upper limit to diversification and robustness in the light of adaptive processes and external perturbations.

Opinion spreading and consensus formation on complex networks,"We study a model of opinion spreading and consensus formation in a population on complex networks. Given a static network structure, the individuals can diffuse on it when two neighboring individuals’ opinions are beyond the “bounded confidence” ε. This is the case that arises in political situations while the opinions of voters can be adapted promptly after communication. The model is governed by the following two rules. At each time step, each individual can exchange their opinions with their neighbors if the difference of their opinions is smaller than ε; otherwise, one can move to an vacancy location if permitted. The distribution of opinions over the population evolves towards either a consensus that all individuals share the same opinion or polarization and fragmentation state. The statistical properties of this final state vary considerably as the model parameters change. It is shown that, when the dispersal abilities of the individuals are considered, the bounded confidence which is required to attain consensus can be remarkably decrease.",,Social and behavioural science,3,Feng Wang,Computer Science,Computing,"Hello, everyone!

Robustness Analysis of the Heat Shock Response using semiquantitative Reasoning,"The Heat Shock Response (HSR) is a universal procedure among organisms that repairs protein damage in- duced by heat and other stresses. It is a simple biological mechanism that is yet rich enough to be analyzed from the perspective of robustness and efficiency. A series of papers by El-Samad et al. [1], [2] have presented a control theoretical approach for studying HSR in Escherichia coli bacteria. They argue that the complexity of the HSR control mechanism is necessary to achieve the observed robustness of such biological systems.
We extend the control theoretical approach, applying interval analysis to Lyapunov’s indirect method, and consider the robustness of the HSR with respect to uncertainties in the individual chemical reaction rates. In order to design alternative control mechanisms for the HSR we compute the optimal control to the protein damage-repair cycle.

We use tag co-occurrence networks for a sample domain of tags to analyze the meaning of particular tags given their relationship to other tags (using a structuralist approach to meaning) and automatically create an on- tology. We also produce a generative model of collaborative tagging in order to model and understand some of the basic dynamics behind the process.",Computer Science,Social and behavioural science;Computing,3,Harry Halpin,,,,,Male,,University of Edinburgh,United Kingdom,Top 50,2006,Santa Fe,Fabian,

My scientific research interests began with synthetic biology and the study of bacterial quorum sensing and broadened from there to include systems biology and the evolution of multicellularity. I am now primarily interested in applying, as yet abstract, tools from mathematics and theoretical computer science to a mereological description of the evolution of hierarchical organization in biological systems that incorporates niche construction with selection in order to derive a more concrete computational model of such. In this context, and being at least a token ontological reductionist, I am also interested in the hierarchical relationship between information representation in molecular and linguistic forms as may be addressed at the level of abstraction of semiotics.

NA2,,NA,,2,Xiaoli Dong,"Sustainability, Ecology",Environmental protection;Life sciences,"I am a third year PhD student, working in fluvial landscapes, and am interested in spatial ecology.

As we walk along a stream or a river, we see different species are located in different places. Some sets of species colonize together to form a patch. Some patches have regular patterns while others do not and the geometry of patches may vary widely. Groups of patches are arrayed in space and water flow through and across them. Dissolved nutrients may be taken up or released and organisms can migrate from patch to patch.

Why are ecosystem components located where they are? Is the existing structure optimal for individual within it? How do we even define optimality? How does the spatial structure change over time? Is change directional? If so, what is the mechanism of directionality?

We are puzzled by what we see - the forms of landscapes - and we may contemplate the relationship between form and function. The form-function relationship is a classic concern in physiology and evolutionary biology; yet, the same question, asked at the level of an ecosystem, is stimulating: what is the relationship between landscape heterogeneity and its functioning? To be more specific: how is spatial heterogeneity formed, how does spatial heterogeneity influence ecosystem functioning, and how does ecosystem functioning feedback on spatial structures, if it does so at all? These are the major questions of my dissertation. I do both manipulative experiments in the field and simulation models to answer these questions.

While the amount of work that I can do for my degree is limited, the questions that I propose reach out to more fundamental ideas (1) form-function relationships in complex systems: In physiology, the relationship between form and function is clear: organs are the way they are because they are functional improvements generated by natural selection. However, the form-function relationship gets much more complicated in a complex system like a landscape-ecosystem, a hierarchical level where natural selection does not operate. Rather, self-organization may play an analogous role. This leads to another fundamental idea for ecosystems: (2) Natural selection (NS) vs. self-organization (SO): The definitions of the terms suggest that NS maximizes fitness whereas SO maximize the rate of energy/material flow. As an individual, an organism ""tries"" to maximize its survivorship and reproduction (e.g. to overcome water and nutrient limitation, etc.). As a group of interacting individuals, organisms are patterned into spatial structures. How are these individuals and collective forces reconciled? Does SO help increase fitness? My research endeavors to develop an integrated framework for ecosystems as complex adaptive systems. The broader theoretical foundation is rooted in the intersection of evolutionary theory and ecosystem ecology and in the intersection of community ecology and ecosystem ecology. I look forward to stimulating and challenging discussions on these topics.",Chinese,Female,Student,Arizona State University,United States,101-150,2012,Santa Fe,Kyle,

In more practical terms, I would like study how organisms and people cope (and thrive) in places where the supply of essential water resources (in the form of rainfall) is unpredictable both in terms of the amount and of its temporal distribution. This issue of unpredictability, or randomness in time, is manifested at multiple time scales--from the daily to the interannual--which all compound to the challenge of trying to maximize effective water use.

My latest project is in trying to quantify the level of rainfall seasonality in the tropics by decomposing time series.

Eventually I would like to look at how such rainfall variability, as a dominant ecological force, is propagated through different levels in the ecosystem. And whether a variety of coping strategies, both from nature (e.g., drought avoidance and deciduousness) and from human management (e.g., irrigation, fertilization), can help to stablize the ecosystem against unforeseen extreme events (e.g., fire, disease, catastrophic climate change). In other words, how does the diversity of responses contribute to the resilience of the ecosystem?

For modeling, I alternate between Mathematica, Matlab, and Python.

Before that, I did 2 years of a philosophy PhD program there, where I was interested in general philosophy of science and also philosophy of physics, particularly issues of emergence (classical dynamics from quantum, and the thermodynamic arrow of time from time-symmetric stat mech), and before that I got my undergraduate degree in Physics and Philosophy from Oxford (where, among other things, I did a project on the evolution of matter in the universe under various models of dark energy (!)). I won't go into the details of how I ended up shifting over to linguistics, but I'll just say a bit about my current interests. Broadly, I am interested in understanding why languages have the structures they do, both structure that is common to all languages (there is a lot less of this than one might think, but there are at least some very general commonalities) and those that seem to vary cross-linguistically. It seems to me that modeling language as a complex adaptive system is very apt, given the nature of language as an evolving system based in interactions between agents and constrained by many different factors (such as biology, cognitive abilities, information transmission pressures, and of course culture). Contrary to previous theories of language where most of the structure was thought to be due to some sort of innate language faculty, I want to explore to what extent it is possible to account for the structure and evolutionary behaviour of language by modelling it as a complex system, which depends on all the sorts of domain-general factors mentioned above, as well as domain-general learning mechanisms, such as statistical and analogical learning. I have a number of specific projects I'm just beginning to work on, but at the CSSS I'm mostly interested in gaining modelling tools that I can apply to building agent-based simulations of language learning and language evolution. From various conversations with people today, I thought I'd mention a few other things I am interested in and would love to talk more about over coffee or somesuch during the next few weeks: information theory, category theory, social networks, logic and philosophy, cognition, neural networks, and of course anything physics related. I am also deeply interested in art and music, and like to make a bit of both (as well as study patterns in them!). Other interests (passions?) include food and hiking, so if anyone wants to partake in any of these activities at any point, hit me up. Finally, I would just like to say that I am extremely excited to be here - this is perhaps the first time in my life I've truly felt surrounded by like-minded people, and I can't wait to learn from you all (and of course make friends with you all too).",,Female,Student,University of California Davis,United States,51-100,2012,Santa Fe,Kyle,

",Life sciences,"Victor Quintanar-Zilinskas is a graduate student at the University of California, Irvine.  His current research focus,  linked with the experimental results of his collaborators Xiangmin Xu, Ron Frostig, and Raju Metherate, is system-level dynamics and information processing in many-neuron (on the order of 1000s) networks.  His advisors are Zoran Nenadic and SFI faculty member Arthur Lander.
Over the next five years, Victor intends to turn the focus of his
 network modeling to the study of 1) the information-processing 
consequences of the brain's frequent brief episodes of self-organized 
synchrony between groups of neurons 2) the potential for cognitive 
utilization of information generated by complex dynamics (Turing 
patterns are an illustration of such generation); what he will learn 
this summer at SFI
 (from both modules and peers) will be highly applicable to the pursuit 
of these topics.  The latter topic is particularly difficult to study, 
but information-generative modeling and olfactory computation results are likely starting points of reference.
Victor was raised in Palo Alto, CA and his interests and outlooks are heavily influenced by his upbringing in Silicon Valley's technoculture.  He double-majored in math and biology at Santa Clara University
 (class of 2009), where he did his first computational neuroscience 
research, sparking his current interests.  He also worked with Geoffrey Bowker (who was, at the time, at Santa Clara University)
 to characterize the work practices of scholar communities that study 
complex systems (e.g. networks of ecologists that study various facets 
of the same ecosystem); it was while on this project that he developed 
his appreciation for the study of black swan emergence events (e.g. 
shifts between stable states of the composition of an ocean bacteria 
population; large storms).  Victor's current ""applied philosophy"" 
interest is the connections between Constructivism, creativity theory, and interdisciplinarity.

NA1,,NA,,5,Vanessa Ferdinand,Language Evolution,Humanities,"Background: Anthropology, Linguistics, Cognitive Science

Currently 2nd-year PhD student in Language Evolution at the University of Edinburgh

Interests: I'm interested in mapping out the evolutionary dynamics involved in cultural transmission systems. I also wonder whether general evolutionary frameworks for culture are possible, or if different transmission systems (ex: social network typology) or the cultural information that's being passed on (ex: language, music, religious beliefs) are too idiosyncratic to be lumped together and modeled generally.

Mainly, I research how the learning biases of individuals in a population map to the emergent structure of the language that they share - and look at how the transmission process itself modulates this. My master thesis addressed this problem with an iterated learning model of cultural transmission with Bayesian agents. Iterated learning models highlight language as a complex dynamic system that adapts to the environment which it propagates through; the environment here is the cognitive constraints of the humans (or agents) that learn and use the language. The main results we get for these types of models is that language becomes more learnable and structured via use.

I'd like to gain more tools to analyze these data sets with and as many outside perspectives on my work as possible.

Currently, I'm experimenting with human probability matching behavior and trying to formulate simple cognitive biases in terms of selection pressures in a culturally evolving systems. In particular, I'm searching for mechanisms and processes in social learning that can support the appearance of drift at the surface level of a culture: for example, counting up the number of different names that parents give their children each year is a surface level measure of cultural variation, where each variant is a baby name. And looking into the process by which parents actually choose their baby's name gives us a mechanistic understanding of how the variation we witness is generated.

Recent research is claiming that lots of cultural change over time just looks like drift. And generally, drift is something we try to formulate as a neutral model, which we would like to rule out to see if the change we witness is due to something more interesting then just sampling error - but to something like a selection pressure due to the functionality or fitness of one cultural variant over another. However, it is questionable whether true drift processes occur in cultural evolution: what could possibly be an ""uninteresting"" change that occurs for a system that must replicate by passing through human cognition? That's a great question...",,Female,Student,University of Edinburgh,United Kingdom,Top 50,2012,Santa Fe,Kyle,

ABM, and later on through PDE, I plan to investigate the consumer’s 
adoption of eco-friendly products over a limited period of time over a

performance and resilience) in coupled human-engineered systems.  I 
contend that a lack of understanding about the interactions between 
these systems is a major barrier to sustainability implementation in the
 industrial sector.  My research context is water management within the 
minerals industry.  I'm adopting a systems modelling approach to study 
engineered systems, combined with social network analysis to look at 
human systems.  Building on Ashby’s law of requisite variety, I 
hypothesise that performance of the coupled system will be best when 
human and engineered systems are aligned according to their complexity. 
 I will test this hypothesis through gathering empirical data from case 
study sites.

understanding of sustainability and the practical challenges associated 
with its implementation in the industrial sector.  I look forward to 
some engaging in some insightful discussions with others who have 
interests in this field. 
Through my PhD I'm developing a good understanding of the various
 statistical models available to analyse social network data.  The 
programs I've been using so far are UCINET and Netdraw, and I intend to 
use PNet down the track to investigate the factors driving network 
evolution.   
What do I hope to get out of CSSS?     I'm excited about 
all of the modules!  I’m particularly eager to learn about structure and
 dynamics across multi-scale networks and to advance my understanding of
 network emergence, resilience and robustness.  I also look forward to 
exploring approaches to conceptualize (and hopefully measure!) 
complexity in an empirical context, and to learn about novel approaches 
for validating models of complex systems. 
Possible projects  I'll have a think about this...  But it
 could be interesting to do a project investigating sustainability 
challenges across different political and/or industrial regions, drawing
 on the diversity of scholars' experiences.  Perhaps an investigation 
into the challenges of meeting multi-objectives across diverse 
industrial, governance and societal systems?

the complex systems group. My main area of research is Evolutionary 
Robotics: using evolutionary algorithms to evolve complete robot brains 
and bodies. So my interests lie in evolution (biological and 
artificial), neural networks (biological and artificial), and a variety 
of other areas including dynamical systems and cognition. 
For more info about my research and to see my publications check out my website here
I have experience programming in many languages and am well 
versed in many modern genetic algorithms (and other forms of 
evolutionary computation/stochastic optimization) all of which may be 
useful for a variety of projects.
Besides my academic interests I love being outdoors.  I am an 
avid fan of winter sports (mostly snowboarding, but sometimes skiing) 
not that I will get to do much of that this time of year. I also like to
 hike, mountain bike and to play volleyball and ultimate.

My other main interest is live music.  I love going to see good 
musicians perform, and I am a fan of a wide range of styles.  I hope to 
check out the local music scene while I am in Santa Fe.


I look forward to getting to know everyone and learning a lot!

,,,,,Kameron Harris,Applied Mathematics,Mathematics and statistics,"Hello! I am a MS student studying applied mathematics at the 
University of Vermont. My interests are broad but could basically be 
described as applying physics-like mathematical models wherever they are
 useful.
I am also okay with applying them where they are not useful from 
time to time, so long as it's fun (the mad physicist toy model streak).

My lab centers around the microscopic movers and shakers of the 
planet. We model the interactions of microbes with their environment and
 also with each other to suggest ways in which we can modify their 
behavior to accomplish important socioeconomic tasks. Our models suggest
 dynamic regulatory relationships and influences between molecular parts
 within an organism and provide a means to compare regulatory 
architectures across species. We strongly emphasize the role of gene 
regulatory reorganization in adaptation. 
As for my specific research interests, I am fascinated by 
biological information processing -- or at least how we can observe and 
predict the propagation of information within living systems.

NA1,,NA,,5,Sandro Colizzi,Theoretical Biology,Life sciences,"I'm a first year PhD student at Utrecht University, the Netherlands. I work in the field of Theoretical Biology. I did my bachelor in Biotechnology in University of Padova, Italy, I thought that working in a wet lab was not for me, which is why I switched to a master in Theoretical Biology (in Utrecht). My project is about investigating how evolution codes, maintains, accumulates and processes information both at the ecosystem level and at the individual level, when interacting agents have an explicitly defined genome and their (exquisitely emerging) functionalities depend on an enormously complicated genotype-to-phenotype map. I'm interested in all fields of science, I like philosophy, literature and a bunch of other stuff... but I guess you know it by now, since I'm writing this at the end of the third week.",Italian,Male,Student,Utrecht University,Netherlands,51-100,2012,Santa Fe,Kyle,
,,,,,Stefani Crabtree,Anthropology,Social and behavioural science,"Stefani is a current Masters student in anthropology and an NSF 
graduate research fellow.  She began studying archaeology as an exchange
 student in Paris taking classes in Egyptology and the Archaeology of 
Islam. Returning to Scripps College in Claremont, CA she majored in 
Anthropology and French, writing her undergraduate thesis on a 
Gallo-Roman site she helped excavate in 2003. Upon graduation she was 
awarded a Thomas J. Watson Fellowship which enabled her to complete a 
multi-sited ethnography on how women of indigenous cultures use 
traditional medicine in pregnancy and childbirth researching in New 
Zealand, Samoa, India and Vietnam. Since returning to the country she 
has worked for a non-profit human rights organization and two cultural 
resource management firms—CRAI and SWCA Environmental Consultants as 
crew member, assistant crew chief and crew chief.
Stefani is interested in questions of how humans’ decisions have 
affected their overall evolutionary fitness, and how changes in the 
environment forced humanity to adapt differing strategies to ensure 
their overall survival. She believes that through understanding which 
adaptive choices of previous hominids were successful and which failed, 
we can help provide transformative options to the parallel and 
potentially equally drastic problems humans are facing today.
Aside from the academic, Stefani has produced a CD and was a 
semi-pro musician in Denver (www.stefanicrabtree.com for the curious).  
She rock climbs, is a serious yogi and is also a serious cook (http://cookingarchaeologist.blogspot.com/).  When not in front of her computer coding she is found either in the field working or running around playing in the outdoors.
